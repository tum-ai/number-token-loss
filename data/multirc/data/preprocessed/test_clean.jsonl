That soul will hate the ev'ning mist  So often lovely, and will list  To the sound of the coming darkness (known  To those whose spirits hearken) as one  Who, in a dream of night, _would_ fly,  But _cannot_, from a danger nigh.  What tho' the moon--tho' the white moon  Shed all the splendor of her noon,  _Her_ smile is chilly--and _her_ beam,  In that time of dreariness, will seem  (So like you gather in your breath)  A portrait taken after death.  And boyhood is a summer sun  Whose waning is the dreariest one--  For all we live to know is known,  And all we seek to keep hath flown--  Let life, then, as the day-flower, fall  With the noon-day beauty--which is all.  I reached my home--my home no more--  For all had flown who made it so.  I passed from out its mossy door,  And, tho' my tread was soft and low,  A voice came from the threshold stone  Of one whom I had earlier known--  O, I defy thee, Hell, to show  On beds of fire that burn below,  An humbler heart--a deeper woe.\n\nQuestion: What is the appropriate time that the passage takes place?", "answer": ""}

{"question": "Former prosecutor Michael Mazzariello was finally doing the kind of legal work he'd always dreamed of, but after less than a year of helping East New York's poor, he's getting booted from the bodega he turned into an office. Nearly a year ago, Mazzariello, a former assistant district attorney who grew up in East New York, started a nonprofit practice helping the working poor navigate the legal system. Immigration, landlord-tenant disputes and even criminal cases are the specialty of his East New York Legal Services Corp. on New Lots Ave. The office, in a former bodega, was Mazzariello's idea, and he got some help from high places early on. \"I picked up the phone and called Rudy Giuliani on his radio program,\" Mazzariello said. \"I said, 'Mr. Mayor, we're interested in renting space in a building the city owns. \"I swear, within an hour, the building was ours. We filled out all the paperwork. We got the nonprofit status from the feds. We were rolling.\" Refusing to charge clients, Mazzariello, 42, said he used his family's savings to sustain the office during the first year. Already recognized as a federal nonprofit, the agency is awaiting state status that would allow it to survive on charitable donations. \"This is what I want to do - to give back to the community,\" said Mazzariello, who worked under Brooklyn District Attorney Charles Hynes from 1990 to 1993, followed by a stint as the Board of Education's chief prosecutor. Under the city Housing Preservation and Development Department's tenant ownership program, Mazzariello and partner Joe Guzzo learned they could rent to own. They invested $8,500 in a new facade, rest room makeover and other modest improvements.\n\nQuestion: How did they get the building they were working in? did they buy it or rent it?", "answer": ""}

{"question": "One day a boy was looking for a school lunch in the fridge. He was looking for something that was good for him, but also something that tasted good. He was going to school, and needed something to keep him going and doing well in class. Recently he had been eating cookies for lunch, and was tired by the end of the day. The cookies came from the school lunchroom, and his mom didn't know about them. Finally he got tired of cookies and thought he needed something good for him. So, he asked his mom to come help him out. First he got a doughnut. \"That's not good for you at all!\" said his mom. So, his mom got a big bag of broccoli. \"Yuk, I hate the taste of broccoli,\" said the boy. They looked and looked and couldn't find anything that looked good to the boy that was also good for him. Finally, they saw the perfect thing: some grilled chicken from the party on the weekend. It was so delicious the first time, and it tasted great cold for lunch. The chicken had the types of food he needed to get through the day.\n\nQuestion: What tasted great cold for lunch?", "answer": ""}

{"question": "I pulled out the hammer and one of the stakes. He leapt over the pews, soaring like a grasshopper, and drew a gleaming knife in midair. I dodged, but he tossed it, and I held the box in front of my face. The blade lodged in the wood, its silver point penetrating the velvet and nearly reaching my skin. My arms shook from the force of his throw. Then he landed heavy beside me and I scrambled to stand. His first move pulled out the dagger, almost wrenching my arms from their sockets as I held on to the box, and the second shattered the box with a crushing punch that sent me reeling backwards. I dropped the splinters and the broken second stake and raised my hammer, ready to drive the ash spike into his heart. Behind him, I saw Nepthys running between the pews. I braced my legs against the stone floor and he was on me. I raised the stake; he drew back the dagger for a slash that could doubtless open my neck from throat to spine. The stake went down, there was a blur, and then my hands were empty and I felt pain under my jaw. Two points of fire opened in my throat for an instant, then all went numb. Taste, hearing and touch became a single blur, and I do not know if my eyes were open. My mind began to dissipate, but then I felt the pain withdraw and a lifeless voice said, \"This one's blood isn't worth drinking.\" Hands closed on my neck and I felt my spine crack. I must have fallen to the floor then. I could perceive Nepthys' sword flashing over me, and I heard steel crack, then bone. I thought I heard Rachel's voice blearily calling for me. Then one set of footsteps began walking toward the altar. I was content to let myself drift away, and I had almost forgotten the body lying with broken neck on the cathedral's hard tiles when I felt a warm touch on its cheek.\n\nQuestion: Who was running behind the man who had leapt over the pews, soaring like a grasshopper?", "answer": ""}

Taste, hearing and touch became a single blur, and I do not know if my eyes were open. My mind began to dissipate, but then I felt the pain withdraw and a lifeless voice said, \"This one's blood isn't worth drinking.\" Hands closed on my neck and I felt my spine crack. I must have fallen to the floor then. I could perceive Nepthys' sword flashing over me, and I heard steel crack, then bone. I thought I heard Rachel's voice blearily calling for me.

My arms shook from the force of his throw. Then he landed heavy beside me and I scrambled to stand. His first move pulled out the dagger, almost wrenching my arms from their sockets as I held on to the box, and the second shattered the box with a crushing punch that sent me reeling backwards.

{"question": "On January 25, Tenet briefed the President on the Cole investigation. The written briefing repeated for top officials of the new administration what the CIA had told the Clinton White House in November. This included the \"preliminary judgment\" that al Qaeda was responsible, with the caveat that no evidence had yet been found that  Bin Laden himself ordered the attack. Tenet told us he had no recollection of a conversation with the President about this briefing. In his January 25 memo, Clarke had advised Rice that the government should respond to the Cole attack, but \"should take advantage of the policy that 'we will respond at a time, place and manner of our own choosing' and not be forced into knee-jerk responses.\" Before Vice President Cheney visited the CIA in mid-February, Clarke sent him a memo-outside the usual White House document-management system-suggesting that he ask CIA officials \"What additional information is needed before CIA can definitively conclude that al-Qida was responsible\" for the Cole. In March 2001, the CIA's briefing slides for Rice were still describing the CIA's \"preliminary judgment\" that a \"strong circumstantial case\" could be made against al Qaeda but noting that the CIA continued to lack \"conclusive information on external command and control\" of the attack. Clarke and his aides continued to provide Rice and Hadley with evidence reinforcing the case against al Qaeda and urging action. The President explained to us that he had been concerned lest an ineffectual air strike just serve to give  Bin Laden a propaganda advantage. He said he had not been told about Clinton administration warnings to the Taliban. The President told us that he had concluded that the United States must use ground forces for a job like this. Rice told us that there was never a formal, recorded decision not to retaliate specifically for the Cole attack. Exchanges with the President, between the President and Tenet, and between herself and Powell and Rumsfeld had produced a consensus that \"tit-for-tat\" responses were likely to be counterproductive. This had been the case, she thought, with the cruise missile strikes of August 1998. The new team at the Pentagon did not push for action. On the contrary, Rumsfeld thought that too much time had passed and his deputy, Paul Wolfowitz, thought that the Cole attack was \"stale.\" Hadley said that in the end, the administration's real response to the Cole would be a new, more aggressive strategy against al Qaeda. The administration decided to propose to Congress a substantial increase in counterterrorism funding for national security agencies, including the CIA and the FBI.\n\nQuestion: Who was the Vice President in office when Tenet briefed the President on the Cole investigation?", "answer": ""}

Roberta was quite sure that her invitation and that of Mr Croft was a piece of artful management on the part of the old lady, and imagined, though she was not quite sure about it, that it was intended as a bit of match-making. To get her married to somebody else, would be, of course, the best possible method of preventing her marrying Junius; and this, she had reason to believe, was the prime object of old Mrs Keswick's existence. But why should Mr Croft be chosen as the man with whom she was to be thrown. She had learned that the old lady had seen him before, but was quite certain that her acquaintance with him was slight.

During the evening she sustained the main part of the conversation, giving the company a great many anecdotes and reminiscences of old times and old families, relating them in an odd and peculiar way that was very interesting, especially to Croft, to whom the subject matter was quite new. But, although her three companions listened to the old lady with deferential attention, interspersed with appropriate observations, each one made her the object of severe mental scrutiny, and endeavored to discover the present object of her scheming old mind. Roberta was quite sure that her invitation and that of Mr Croft was a piece of artful management on the part of the old lady, and imagined, though she was not quite sure about it, that it was intended as a bit of match-making. To get her married to somebody else, would be, of course, the best possible method of preventing her marrying Junius; and this, she had reason to believe, was the prime object of old Mrs Keswick's existence. But why should Mr Croft be chosen as the man with whom she was to be thrown. She had learned that the old lady had seen him before, but was quite certain that her acquaintance with him was slight. Could Junius have told his aunt about the friendship between herself and Mr Croft? It was not like him, but a great many unlikely things take place.\n\nQuestion: What are the names of two guests at the dinner with Mrs. Keswick?", "answer": ""}

{"question": "The recent death of the \"snake-handling\" pastor of a small Pentecostal church in Kentucky has raised an age-old conflict between church and state. Jamie Coots, the pastor of the Full Gospel Tabernacle in Jesus Name in Middlesboro, Kentucky, died after being bitten on his right hand by a rattlesnake during a weekend church service where he was handling rattlesnakes willingly, it seems. It has been reported that the late pastor's son Cody Coots has continued the snake-handling tradition even after his father's death. People handle snakes at church for the same reason that people do lots of things: the Bible tells them so. \"And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with new tongues; They shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.\" Mark 16:17-18 This biblical passage is the genesis of serpent-handling for churches of the Holiness movement and the Pentecostal Church of God. For the faithful, those two verses are the authority for dancing with or passing around poisonous snakes during church services. Moreover, if bitten, they are likely to refuse medical treatment and rely upon God to heal them. There's just one problem with this Biblical authority. Another authority, known as the Commonwealth of Kentucky. In Kentucky, the practice is illegal. Well, barely. Under the applicable section KRS Â§437.060, any person who displays, handles or uses a snake in connection with any religious gathering shall be fined $50 to 100. Hardly a capital offense. The Kentucky legislature has sent a message: poisonous snake-handling is marginally illegal -- but not as illegal as drugs or other crimes. The legislature's assigned penalty appears to fall somewhere between a speeding ticket and an overdue library book.\n\nQuestion: In Kentucky, can you use poisonous snakes during church services?", "answer": ""}

{"question": "Alexander began his reign by eliminating potential rivals to the throne. He had his cousin, the former Amyntas IV, executed. He also had two Macedonian princes from the region of Lyncestis killed, but spared a third, Alexander Lyncestes. Olympias had Cleopatra Eurydice and Europa, her daughter by Philip, burned alive. When Alexander learned about this, he was furious. Alexander also ordered the murder of Attalus, who was in command of the advance guard of the army in Asia Minor and Cleopatra's uncle. Attalus was at that time corresponding with Demosthenes, regarding the possibility of defecting to Athens. Attalus also had severely insulted Alexander, and following Cleopatra's murder, Alexander may have considered him too dangerous to leave alive. Alexander spared Arrhidaeus, who was by all accounts mentally disabled, possibly as a result of poisoning by Olympias. News of Philip's death roused many states into revolt, including Thebes, Athens, Thessaly, and the Thracian tribes north of Macedon. When news of the revolts reached Alexander, he responded quickly. Though advised to use diplomacy, Alexander mustered 3,000 Macedonian cavalry and rode south towards Thessaly. He found the Thessalian army occupying the pass between Mount Olympus and Mount Ossa, and ordered his men to ride over Mount Ossa. When the Thessalians awoke the next day, they found Alexander in their rear and promptly surrendered, adding their cavalry to Alexander's force. He then continued south towards the Peloponnese. Alexander stopped at Thermopylae, where he was recognized as the leader of the Amphictyonic League before heading south to Corinth. Athens sued for peace and Alexander pardoned the rebels.

{"question": "Free Legal advice is only a phone call away - and the hot lines that provide it are expanding their services. It's a little known perk available to anyone 60 or older: 21 states, Washington D.C., and Puerto Rico operate legal-assistance hot lines for older adults and most take calls from younger caregivers as well. Volunteers offer advice on legal questions, provide self-help materials, and make referrals to legal aid offices and pro bono or reduced-fee private lawyers. Even if you live in a state without a hot line, local agencies on aging will provide you with referrals to nearby lawyers. The hot lines and referral services tackle estate planning, pension, and health benefits, elder abuse and neglect, guardianship custodial issues involving grandchildren, consumer protection and other elder-law issues. The U.S. administration on Aging coordinates this loosely knit legal-services network. Anyone who meets the age requirement can call the hot line, but hands-on legal counsel goes first to people with the greatest financial or social needs. The federal Agency recently awarded $2 million in grants to improve elder-law services, with the largest part being used to bolster 12 hotlines around the country, some of which are adding Web-based questionnaires and outreach projects in rural areas and for older people who don't speak English. For a list of where the hotlines operate, along with their phone numbers and hours, go to www.aoa.gov/legal/hotline.html, or call the federal Eldercare Locator at 800-677-1116. If you live in a state without a hot line, the locator can point you to local legal assistance. Another source of low-cost help also expanded this year: AARP's Legal Services Network is now available in 46 states and expects to reach all 50 by the end of March. You have to pay the group's dues ($10 a year) to use the services; after that you get 30 minutes of legal counseling, either face-to-face or by phone, at no cost. Lawyers discount their usual rate by 20% after that. Simple wills cost $75 apiece. You can reach the service at 800-424-3410 or go to www.aarp.org/LSN to find a lawyer nearby.\n\nQuestion: Which group do you have to pay $10 a year for their service?", "answer": ""}

The federal Agency recently awarded $2 million in grants to improve elder-law services, with the largest part being used to bolster 12 hotlines around the country, some of which are adding Web-based questionnaires and outreach projects in rural areas and for older people who don't speak English. For a list of where the hotlines operate, along with their phone numbers and hours, go to www.aoa.gov/legal/hotline.html, or call the federal Eldercare Locator at 800-677-1116. If you live in a state without a hot line, the locator can point you to local legal assistance. Another source of low-cost help also expanded this year: AARP's Legal Services Network is now available in 46 states and expects to reach all 50 by the end of March. You have to pay the group's dues ($10 a year) to use the services; after that you get 30 minutes of legal counseling, either face-to-face or by phone, at no cost. Lawyers discount their usual rate by 20% after that. Simple wills cost $75 apiece. You can reach the service at 800-424-3410 or go to www.aarp.org/LSN to find a lawyer nearby.\n\nQuestion: What services are provided after paying the membership dues for AARP's Legal Services Network?", "answer": ""}

{"question": "There was a little murmur of protest at this, for the house appeared to be scarcely bigger than the automobile.  But Uncle John pointed out, sensibly enough, that they ought not to undertake an unknown road at nighttime, and that Spotville, the town for which they were headed, was still a long way off.  The Major, moreover, had a vivid recollection of his last night's bed upon the roof of the limousine, where he had crept to escape rattlesnakes, and was in no mood to again camp out in the open while they traveled in Arizona.  So he advocated accepting Dan'l's invitation.  The girls, curious to know how so many could be accommodated in the bungalow, withdrew all further objections and stood upon the low, pergola-roofed porch while their host went inside to light the lamps.  They were really surprised at the cosy aspect of the place.  Half the one-story dwelling was devoted to a living room, furnished simply but with modest taste.  A big square table was littered with music, much being in manuscript--thus proving Dan'l's assertion that he was a composer.  Benches were as numerous as chairs, and all were well-cushioned with tanned skins as coverings.  A few good prints were on the walls and the aspect of the place was entirely agreeable to the old man's guests.\n\nQuestion: What was the bungalow scarcely bigger than?", "answer": ""}

{"question": "Strange things have always happened to my family.

When I asked her if she'd ever seen them – before I was old enough to stop believing, I mean – she would always look sad and tell me, \"No, not since the family came to America has anything happened to us. But if you ever should see a faerie, tell him that you are of the blood of Ivan Bogatyrivitch and he will not pass you by so quickly.\" As I got older, I shook the tales off with a nod and a \"Yes, Nana.\" I got older and went to school, then to college, and I replaced the dreams my Nana gave me with the music DJs mixed for crowds in clubs, webs of pulse that shook us until we could believe anything. My girlfriend Rachel and I would go to the clubs near our school.

{"question": "Strange things have always happened to my family. It came in through my mother's blood; my Russian grandmother would always tell me stories, bylichkas, of ancestors with the \"second sight\", stupid mill owners who discovered bags of gold after letting a special fish off their hooks, and dark strangers who used to appear to help or interfere at crucial times. When I asked her if she'd ever seen them – before I was old enough to stop believing, I mean – she would always look sad and tell me, \"No, not since the family came to America has anything happened to us. But if you ever should see a faerie, tell him that you are of the blood of Ivan Bogatyrivitch and he will not pass you by so quickly.\" As I got older, I shook the tales off with a nod and a \"Yes, Nana.\" I got older and went to school, then to college, and I replaced the dreams my Nana gave me with the music DJs mixed for crowds in clubs, webs of pulse that shook us until we could believe anything. My girlfriend Rachel and I would go to the clubs near our school. Sometimes we'd get word that people were gathering under one of the bridges, and we'd rush down to hit it before the cops broke it up. Boston is a strange place at night.

{"question": "Leaves are the keys not only to plant life but to virtually all life on land. The primary role of leaves is to collect sunlight. This sunlight is needed for the plant to make food. Leaves vary in size, shape, and how they are arranged on stems. You can see examples of different types of leaves in Figure 3.4. Each type of leaf is well suited for the plants environment. It maximizes light exposure while conserving water. They also reduces wind resistance. Leaves also benefit the plant in some other way in its particular habitat. For example, some leaves are divided into many smaller leaflets. This reduces wind resistance and water loss. Leaves are basically factories for photosynthesis. A factory has specialized machines to produce a product. In a leaf, the 'machines' are the chloroplasts. A factory is connected to a transportation system that supplies it with raw materials and carries away the finished product. In a leaf, transport is carried out by veins containing vascular tissue. Veins carry water and minerals to the cells of leaves. They carry away dissolved sugar.\n\nQuestion: Why are some leaves divided into smaller leaflets?", "answer": ""}

{"question": "Leaves are the keys not only to plant life but to virtually all life on land. The primary role of leaves is to collect sunlight. This sunlight is needed for the plant to make food. Leaves vary in size, shape, and how they are arranged on stems. You can see examples of different types of leaves in Figure 3.4. Each type of leaf is well suited for the plants environment. It maximizes light exposure while conserving water. They also reduces wind resistance. Leaves also benefit the plant in some other way in its particular habitat. For example, some leaves are divided into many smaller leaflets. This reduces wind resistance and water loss. Leaves are basically factories for photosynthesis.

{"question": "As water flows through, it causes changes. The flowing water dissolves some types of rock. Some rocks dissolve more easily than others. Over time, the water may dissolve large areas of rocks. With enough time, holes, or caves, can form. Groundwater drips from the ceiling to the floor of a cave. Even deep in the ground, water is still pulled by gravity. This falling water is rich in dissolved minerals. Some of these minerals do not stay dissolved. When this happens, the minerals start to build up. They build up on the ceiling of the cave to create formations called stalactites. A stalactite is a pointed, icicle-like mineral. They form on the ceiling of a cave. They drip to the floor of the cave. It is there the minerals in the water harden to form stalagmites. A stalagmite is a more rounded mineral deposit.

{"question": "Pushkin is usually credited with developing Russian literature. Not only is he seen as having originated the highly nuanced level of language which characterizes Russian literature after him, but he is also credited with substantially augmenting the Russian lexicon. Where he found gaps in the Russian vocabulary, he devised calques. His rich vocabulary and highly sensitive style are the foundation for modern Russian literature. His accomplishments set new records for development of the Russian language and culture. He became the father of Russian literature in the 19th century, marking the highest achievements of 18th century and the beginning of literary process of the 19th century. Alexander Pushkin introduced Russia to all the European literary genres as well as a great number of West European writers. He brought natural speech and foreign influences to create modern poetic Russian. Though his life was brief, he left examples of nearly every literary genre of his day: lyric poetry, narrative poetry, the novel, the short story, the drama, the critical essay, and even the personal letter. Pushkin's work as a journalist marked the birth of Russian magazine culture which included him devising and contributing heavily to one of the most influential literary magazines of the 19th century, the Sovremennik (The Contemporary, or Sovremennik). Pushkin inspired the folk tales and genre pieces of other authors: Leskov, Esenin, and Gorky. His use of Russian language formed the basis of the style of novelists Ivan Turgenev, Ivan Goncharov, and Leo Tolstoy, as well as that of subsequent lyric poets such as Mikhail Lermontov. Pushkin was analyzed by Nikolai Vasilyevich Gogol, his successor and pupil, and the great Russian critic Vissarion Grigoryevich Belinsky who has also produced the fullest and deepest critical study of Pushkin's work, which still retains much of its relevance.\n\nQuestion: What other contributions did Pushkin make to the Russian language?", "answer": ""}

{"question": "Feel the top of your desk. Does it look and feel smooth? Yes, it feels and looks smooth, but is it really? Even when surfaces look smooth to the unaided eye, they may not be. Scientists use a microscope to look at things more closely. Through a microscope, smooth surfaces may appear rough or bumpy. Look at the metal surfaces in Figure 1.8. The metal foil is so smooth that it is shiny. However, when highly magnified, it is clearly not smooth. It actually looks to be very bumpy. All those bumps grab the bumps of other surfaces. They grind together. They oppose the motion of the two surfaces. Now you know what causes friction.\n\nQuestion: Do metal surfaces that appear smooth always appear smooth when looked at under a microscope?", "answer": ""}

{"question": "We chose to hold our American colonies by a law that was at least convenient for its framers.  The maxim was, that whoever possessed the coast had a right to all the territory in hand as far as the Pacific; so that the British charters only laid down the limits of the colonies from north to south, leaving them quite free from east to west.  The French, meanwhile, had their colonies to the north and south, and aimed at connecting them by the Mississippi and the St. Lawrence, and the great intermediate lakes and waters lying to the westward of the British possessions.  In the year 1748, though peace was signed between the two European kingdoms, the colonial question remained unsettled, to be opened again when either party should be strong enough to urge it.  In the year 1753 it came to an issue on the Ohio River where the British and French settlers met.  A company called the Ohio Company, having grants from the Virginia government of lands along that river, found themselves invaded in their settlement's by French military detachments, who roughly ejected the Britons from their holdings.

You can see how it occurs in the following diagram. You have probably seen lightning in a rainstorm. What does lighting have to do with static electricity? As it turns out, everything. During a rainstorm, clouds are pushed along by the wind. Clouds develop regions of different charges. This happens due to the movement of air molecules, water drops, and ice particles. The negative charges are mostly at the base of the clouds. The positive charges are mostly at the top. The charges continue to build up. Suddenly, you see the large discharge.

{"question": "On May 29, at Tenet's request, Rice and Tenet converted their usual weekly meeting into a broader discussion on al Qaeda; participants included Clarke, CTC chief Cofer Black, and \"Richard,\" a group chief with authority over the  Bin Laden unit. Rice asked about \"taking the offensive\" and whether any approach could be made to influence  Bin Laden or the Taliban. Clarke and Black replied that the CIA's ongoing disruption activities were \"taking the offensive\" and that  Bin Laden could not be deterred. A wide-ranging discussion then ensued about \"breaking the back\" of  Bin Laden's organization. Tenet emphasized the ambitious plans for covert action that the CIA had developed in December 2000. In discussing the draft authorities for this program in March, CIA officials had pointed out that the spending level envisioned for these plans was larger than the CIA's entire current budget for counterterrorism covert action. It would be a multiyear program, requiring such levels of spending for about five years. The CIA official, \"Richard,\" told us that Rice \"got it.\" He said she agreed with his conclusions about what needed to be done, although he complained to us that the policy process did not follow through quickly enough. Clarke and Black were asked to develop a range of options for attacking  Bin Laden's organization, from the least to most ambitious. Rice and Hadley asked Clarke and his staff to draw up the new presidential directive. On June 7, Hadley circulated the first draft, describing it as \"an admittedly ambitious\" program for confronting al Qaeda. The draft NSPD's goal was to \"eliminate the al Qida network of terrorist groups as a threat to the United States and to friendly governments.\" It called for a multiyear effort involving diplomacy, covert action, economic measures, law enforcement, public diplomacy, and if necessary military efforts. The State Department was to work with other governments to end all al Qaeda sanctuaries, and also to work with the Treasury Department to disrupt terrorist financing. The CIA was to develop an expanded covert action program including significant additional funding and aid to anti-Taliban groups. The draft also tasked OMB with ensuring that sufficient funds to support this program were found in U.S. budgets from fiscal years 2002 to 2006. Rice viewed this draft directive as the embodiment of a comprehensive new strategy employing all instruments of national power to eliminate the al Qaeda threat.\n\nQuestion: How many days was it between the original meeting and Hadley's first draft?", "answer": ""}

{"question": "On May 29, at Tenet's request, Rice and Tenet converted their usual weekly meeting into a broader discussion on al Qaeda; participants included Clarke, CTC chief Cofer Black, and \"Richard,\" a group chief with authority over the  Bin Laden unit. Rice asked about \"taking the offensive\" and whether any approach could be made to influence  Bin Laden or the Taliban. Clarke and Black replied that the CIA's ongoing disruption activities were \"taking the offensive\" and that  Bin Laden could not be deterred. A wide-ranging discussion then ensued about \"breaking the back\" of  Bin Laden's organization. Tenet emphasized the ambitious plans for covert action that the CIA had developed in December 2000. In discussing the draft authorities for this program in March, CIA officials had pointed out that the spending level envisioned for these plans was larger than the CIA's entire current budget for counterterrorism covert action. It would be a multiyear program, requiring such levels of spending for about five years. The CIA official, \"Richard,\" told us that Rice \"got it.\" He said she agreed with his conclusions about what needed to be done, although he complained to us that the policy process did not follow through quickly enough. Clarke and Black were asked to develop a range of options for attacking  Bin Laden's organization, from the least to most ambitious. Rice and Hadley asked Clarke and his staff to draw up the new presidential directive. On June 7, Hadley circulated the first draft, describing it as \"an admittedly ambitious\" program for confronting al Qaeda. The draft NSPD's goal was to \"eliminate the al Qida network of terrorist groups as a threat to the United States and to friendly governments.\" It called for a multiyear effort involving diplomacy, covert action, economic measures, law enforcement, public diplomacy, and if necessary military efforts.

{"question": "About 20 minutes later, at 7:35, another passenger for Flight 77, Hani Hanjour, placed two carry-on bags on the X-ray belt in the Main Terminal's west checkpoint, and proceeded, without alarm, through the metal detector.

Salem al Hazmi cleared the metal detector and was permitted through; Nawaf al Hazmi set off the alarms for both the first and second metal detectors and was then hand-wanded before being passed. In addition, his over-the-shoulder carry-on bag was swiped by an explosive trace detector and then passed.

{"question": "The film starts with a shot of a spaceship flying through space .  El , a crew member , walks through the corridors of the ship when he discovers the eponymous magic portal , a rectangular arch flashing with various colors .  Entering the portal , he is transported into a world of passageways .  Some LEGO creatures appear and build a small car for him to drive through the world of passages .  He then has a close encounter with a two-headed monster who chases him through the various paths of the mysterious world .  After El's car has a bump from a crossing train , the car falls apart .  El finds another portal , and nearly gets eaten by the monster , who ends up in the real world while chasing a leftover tyre from the devoured car and attacks Lindsay Fleay .  El reports his experiences to Captain Paranoia , but neither him nor his shipmate Pee believes him .  However , Captain Paranoia finds another Portal , Which takes him to a `` white expanse '' world , where a plasticine creature messes around with him , making him very annoyed and then flushs him out of the white colored world .

{"question": "\"I don't know … it was going to be just us tonight. I'm not sure I'm up for a night out.\" I was feeling calm and private that night. It seemed like tonight's darkness was small and personal, cupped hands offering a place for two, not the burning, open darkness of a rave. \"Baby, let's go. It's been over a week, and I want to dance. Let's go together, you know you'll have fun once you get into it.\" She bit the inside of her bottom lip, looking at me like I was breaking her poor, sweet heart. I'm a sucker for that, and she knows it. \"Okay, Rachel. Let's go, you're probably right.\" She grinned and gave me a kiss across the table, her lips soft and firm and sticking just enough that she gave the feeling you were really kissing, not just pressing your face into someone else's. \"Let's not get fucked up tonight, though, okay, Rache? We don't – \" \"Sure, babe. Come on, I don't have to get fucked up every time we go out just to enjoy myself. Let's not waste any more time.\" She stood up and I followed her out to the street. It was dark enough that I could actually see a few stars through the screen of city light. Without hearing the car horns, I could almost taste the air of late March through the street fumes. If it was March, that meant that we'd been together almost a year and a half. It was last February, after the winter break, that we moved in together. Now spring was back, under the concrete, and I could smell it even here. \"Isn't it an amazing night, Rache? Even the city feels alive when spring comes.\" \"Taxi!\" She waved down a car and pulled me in.\n\nQuestion: How long had they been together since moving in?", "answer": ""}

{"question": "We had ascertained from the lady that she went down upon the Monday by the train which leaves Waterloo at 9:50, so I started early and caught the 9:13. At Farnham Station I had no difficulty in being directed to Charlington Heath. It was impossible to mistake the scene of the young lady's adventure, for the road runs between the open heath on one side and an old yew hedge upon the other, surrounding a park which is studded with magnificent trees. There was a main gateway of lichen-studded stone, each side pillar surmounted by mouldering heraldic emblems, but besides this central carriage drive I observed several points where there were gaps in the hedge and paths leading through them. The house was invisible from the road, but the surroundings all spoke of gloom and decay. The heath was covered with golden patches of flowering gorse, gleaming magnificently in the light of the bright spring sunshine. Behind one of these clumps I took up my position, so as to command both the gateway of the Hall and a long stretch of the road upon either side. It had been deserted when I left it, but now I saw a cyclist riding down it from the opposite direction to that in which I had come. He was clad in a dark suit, and I saw that he had a black beard. On reaching the end of the Charlington grounds, he sprang from his machine and led it through a gap in the hedge, disappearing from my view.\n\nQuestion: What sort of person did the narrator see?", "answer": ""}

{"question": "In the Narrows, torpedoes were moored at distances of one hundred feet apart, and were connected with the shore by electric wires. At various points along the beach shell-proof huts were constructed, to which these wires led. In each hut was arranged a camera lucida, so that a picture of the harbor, over a limited area, was thrown upon a whitened table. In this way an observer could recognize the instant an enemy's vessel arrived over a sunken mine, and could explode the latter by simply touching a button which allowed the electric current to pass to the torpedo. In the Harbor channels the torpedoes were so arranged as to be exploded on contact of an enemy's vessel with a partially submerged buoy. The torpedo-stations on Staten and Coney Islands and the Jersey coast were provided with movable fish-torpedoes of the Ericsson and Lay types, intended to be sent out against a hostile vessel, and manoeuvred from the shore. All the steam-tugs in the Harbor were moored in Gowanus bay, and each tug was rigged with a long boom projecting from her bow, on which a torpedo, containing some fifty pounds of dynamite, was carried.\n\nQuestion: Where were the buttons which activated the torpedoes?", "answer": ""}

In this way an observer could recognize the instant an enemy's vessel arrived over a sunken mine, and could explode the latter by simply touching a button which allowed the electric current to pass to the torpedo. In the Harbor channels the torpedoes were so arranged as to be exploded on contact of an enemy's vessel with a partially submerged buoy. The torpedo-stations on Staten and Coney Islands and the Jersey coast were provided with movable fish-torpedoes of the Ericsson and Lay types, intended to be sent out against a hostile vessel, and manoeuvred from the shore. All the steam-tugs in the Harbor were moored in Gowanus bay, and each tug was rigged with a long boom projecting from her bow, on which a torpedo, containing some fifty pounds of dynamite, was carried.\n\nQuestion: What allowed an observer, in the narrows, to recognize the instant an enemy's vessel arrived over a sunken mine?", "answer": ""}
{"question": "In 1989 , Kevin Flynn , software engineer and the CEO of ENCOM International , disappears .  Twenty years later , his son , Sam , now ENCOM's primary shareholder , takes little interest in the company beyond playing an annual trick on the board of directors ; but is requested by his father's friend , ENCOM executive Alan Bradley , to investigate a message originating from Flynn's shuttered Video arcade .  There , Sam discovers a hidden basement in Which Sam unintentionally teleports himself to the Grid , a virtual reality created by his father .  On the Grid , Sam is sent to compete against a masked program called Rinzler who , having realized that Sam is a human User after seeing him bleed , takes him before CLU , an alter ego of Kevin Flynn who rules the Grid .  CLU nearly kills Sam in a Light Cycle match ; but the latter is rescued by Quorra , an `` apprentice '' of Flynn's , who conveys him to his father outside CLU's territory .  There , Flynn reveals to Sam that he had been working to create a `` perfect '' computer system and had appointed CLU and Tron its co-creators .  During this construction , the trio discover a species of naturally-occurring `` isomorphic algorithms '' , not conceived by Flynn , bearing the potential to resolve various mysteries in science , religion , and medicine .  CLU , having deemed them an aberration , betrayed Flynn , captured Tron , and destroyed the ISOs .  Meanwhile , the `` I/O portal '' permitting travel between the two worlds had closed , leaving Flynn captive .\n\nQuestion: CLU and Tron are revealed to be the co-creators of what technological ideal, after CLU nearly kills Sam?", "answer": ""}

{"question": "Indigenous Revitalization Movements of Latin America: The Rediscovery of Language and Identity Humans, in the process of defining themselves, look to immediately recognizable factors in order to differentiate themselves from others. This process leads to the development of what can be broadly termed culture: a group of people joined by characteristics, traits, and beliefs comes to view themselves as sharing a distinct identity, discernible from that of those \"outside\" them, those who do not belong. Naturally this can be signaled by any number of things - clothing, food, lifestyle choices. One of the most dominant and easily noted factors is language. The command of a language, while not affording guaranteed access to the community which speaks it, is often the key to gaining entry. In turn communal identity can be formed around a language; it is used as the focal point around which the group gathers. Therefore when considering the indigenous revitalization movements which began in 20th century Latin America, the impact of those indigenous languages on those movements and the nature of the identity of the peoples themselves is key. Language plays a complex and integral role in the development and redefinition of an identity, particularly when that identity has been oppressed and subsumed by a dominant other for as long as that of the indigenous peoples in Latin America has. In particular I will examine two divergent yet remarkably parallel cases, that of the Maya in Guatemala and the Nasa and Guambiano peoples of Colombia. Their struggle to attain status in societies still bearing the marks of Spanish colonialism is deeply tied to their struggle to reaffirm the nature of their \"indigenous identity\", and is in turn linked to the interaction of Spanish and their native languages.\n\nQuestion: What do the Maya in Guatemala and the Nasa and Guambiano peoples of Colombia have in common?", "answer": ""}

{"question": "Friction is a force that works against motion. It occurs between two surfaces that are touching. Friction can be good and bad. How can this be? Think about some common things we do. For example, we put rubber tires on our cars. The tires cause friction against the road. Without rubber tires, the car would slide around. Think about the bottom of your bathtub. Do you have tape that has a sandy texture? Maybe you use a rubber mat. Both materials prevent you from slipping. If you live in a really cold place, you have probably seen icy sidewalks. Perhaps you have put sand on the frozen surface. The sand increases friction. It helps to keep you from slipping and falling. Is friction always a good thing? Too much friction can also be harmful.\n\nQuestion: What is the definition of friction?", "answer": ""}

They frequently occurred within a hundred yards of each other, so serpentine is its course; they are built of stone, and sometimes very neatly finished. Little Washington is in Pennsylvania, across a corner of which the road runs. This is a free state, but we were still waited upon by Negroes, hired from the neighbouring state of Virginia. We arrived at night, and set off again at four in the morning; all, therefore, that we saw of Little Washington was its hotel, which was clean and comfortable. The first part of the next day's journey was through a country much less interesting: its character was unvaried for nearly thirty miles, consisting of an uninterrupted succession of forest-covered hills. As soon as we had wearily dragged to the top of one of these, we began to rumble down the other side as rapidly as our four horses could trot; and no sooner arrived at the bottom than we began to crawl up again; the trees constantly so thick and so high as to preclude the possibility of seeing fifty yards in any direction.\n\nQuestion: They arrived in Little Washington, PA for the night.

{"question": "Not surprisingly, guncite, too, compares data from different years -- as I know from personal experience, it is quite difficult to do comparisons of crime statistics due to differences in reporting frequency and methodology. The gun homicide rates for the countries Moore mentioned, according to guncite, are: Japan: 0.02 per 100,000 (1994)England/Wales: 0.11 per 100,000 (1997)Germany: 0.22 per 100,000 (1994)Australia: 0.44 per 100,000 (1994)United States: 3.72 per 100,000 (1999) Critics fail to credit Moore with not making the same mistake that some gun control advocates make -- concluding that gun ownership \"leads\" to violence. In fact, Moore mentions several counter-examples, and more such counter-examples can indeed be cited. It is intuitively obvious that guns do not actually cause violence -- but it is equally intuitively obvious that they make the violence that is committed more deadly. It is the second intuition which gun rights groups like the NRA seek to obscure using fraudulent data by the likes of John \"Mary\" Lott. The gun control movement, on the other hand, distracts from the real causes of violence -- poverty, paranoia, the \"war on drugs\" and antisexuality. If these causes were addressed, gun ownership in the United States would not be a problem (but also unnecessary); just like it is in Switzerland. Canada ammunition purchase. You write: Bowling shows Moore casually buying ammunition at an Ontario Walmart. He asks us to \"look at what I, a foreign citizen, was able to do at a local Canadian Wal-Mart.\" He buys several boxes of ammunition without a question being raised. \"That's right. I could buy as much ammunition as I wanted, in Canada. Canadian officials have pointed out that the buy is faked or illegal. Once again, you fail to distinguish between regular film editing and \"faking\" (a word which \"Canadian officials\" have never used; for such a distortion, Moore would have been boiled alive by his critics). If Moore simply chose not to show how he revealed his identification to the salesperson, there is nothing fraudulent about that. He made no claims whatsoever in the film about the need to show or not show identification.

{"question": "Miguel and his mother suffer a car accident ; Miguel s mother dies , but the boy miraculously survives without any injuries .

On the first day of lectures , before entering the Medieval History classroom , Miguel watches someone approach .  A girl walks in his direction , and as she enters their eyes immediately meet .

Therefore she is protected by Hector and L dia , envied by Valentina and coveted by Hector's creator , the deadly Victor .  Like Sofia , Miguel is not a mere human .

{"question": "A friend whispers to you in class. You can barely hear them. To hear better you have to lean very close to hear what hes saying. Later that day, your friend shouts to you across the football field. Now his voice is very loud. You have no problem hearing him clearly even though hes many meters away. Obviously, sounds can vary in loudness. Loudness refers to how loud or soft a sound seems to a listener. The loudness of sound is related to the intensity of sound. Intensity is a measure of the amount of energy in sound waves. The unit of intensity is the decibel (dB). The intensity of sound waves determines the loudness of sounds, but what determines intensity? Intensity is a function of two factors. First, the amount of energy contained in the sound waves. Second, how far away you are from the source of the sound. Remember that sound waves start at a source of vibrations. Those sound waves spread out from the source in all directions. The farther the sound waves travel away from the source, the more spread out their energy becomes.\n\nQuestion: What is intensity a function of?", "answer": ""}

Second, how far away you are from the source of the sound. Remember that sound waves start at a source of vibrations. Those sound waves spread out from the source in all directions. The farther the sound waves travel away from the source, the more spread out their energy becomes.\n\nQuestion: When is your friend's voice very loud?", "answer": ""}
{"question": "A friend whispers to you in class. You can barely hear them. To hear better you have to lean very close to hear what hes saying. Later that day, your friend shouts to you across the football field. Now his voice is very loud. You have no problem hearing him clearly even though hes many meters away. Obviously, sounds can vary in loudness. Loudness refers to how loud or soft a sound seems to a listener. The loudness of sound is related to the intensity of sound.

{"question": "From 1512, Maximilian I became Durer's major patron. His commissions included The Triumphal Arch, a vast work printed from 192 separate blocks, the symbolism of which is partly informed by Pirckheimer's translation of Horapollo's Hieroglyphica. The design program and explanations were devised by Johannes Stabius, the architectural design by the master builder and court-painter Jorg Kolderer and the woodcutting itself by Hieronymous Andreae, with Durer as designer-in-chief. The Arch was followed by \"The Triumphal Procession\", the program of which was worked out in 1512 by Marx Treitz-Saurwein and includes woodcuts by Albrecht Altdorfer and Hans Springinklee, as well as Durer. Durer worked with pen on the marginal images for an edition of the Emperor's printed Prayer-Book; these were quite unknown until facsimiles were published in 1808 as part of the first book published in lithography. Durer's work on the book was halted for an unknown reason, and the decoration was continued by artists including Lucas Cranach the Elder and Hans Baldung. Durer also made several portraits of the Emperor, including one shortly before Maximilian's death in 1519.\n\nQuestion: Who devised the design program and explanations for The Triumphal Arch?", "answer": ""}

{"question": "F. Dianne Taylor is executive director of Legal Services of Eastern Missouri. We're all familiar with the Miranda warning, or at least how it sounds in the movies. It includes the statement: \"You have the right to speak to an attorney and to have an attorney present during any questioning. If you cannot afford a lawyer, one will be provided for you at government expense.\" The Miranda warning, though, applies only to criminal cases. What about the less theatrical, but equally troubling, civil problems that can afflict people in any walk of life? U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has estimated that four out of every five low-income people in America who need legal representation don't receive it. That is a sobering observation, to realize that 80 percent of those who need legal help are denied such guidance and counsel. Who are these people? They may be victims of domestic abuse. Perhaps they are elderly people who are swindled out of their life savings or beaten by a neighbor or acquaintance. Maybe they are homeless children who can't attend school because they aren't officially residents of a district. They are our neighbors, our friends, our colleagues. Facing eviction or physical assault or bankruptcy without legal assistance can be every bit as frightening as standing trial on a criminal charge. Issues in civil cases include family matters, housing and employment cases, consumer protection, public benefits and income maintenance. In the year 2000 alone, Legal Services of Eastern Missouri fielded some 30,000 calls for assistance from low-income people in the 21 counties our not-for-profit organization represents. By contrast, approximately 6,500 cases were closed by the organization last year. More than 312,000 people in the eastern Missouri counties stretching from the Iowa border to Jefferson County qualify for legal aid, an increase of more than 10 percent from 1990.\n\nQuestion: Are people with civil cases entitled to a lawyer, even if they can afford one?", "answer": ""}

{"question": "Alexander then chased Darius, first into Media, and then Parthia. The Persian king no longer controlled his own destiny, and was taken prisoner by Bessus, his Bactrian satrap and kinsman. As Alexander approached, Bessus had his men fatally stab the Great King and then declared himself Darius' successor as Artaxerxes V, before retreating into Central Asia to launch a guerrilla campaign against Alexander. Alexander buried Darius' remains next to his Achaemenid predecessors in a regal funeral. He claimed that, while dying, Darius had named him as his successor to the Achaemenid throne. The Achaemenid Empire is normally considered to have fallen with Darius. Alexander viewed Bessus as a usurper and set out to defeat him. This campaign, initially against Bessus, turned into a grand tour of central Asia. Alexander founded a series of new cities, all called Alexandria, including modern Kandahar in Afghanistan, and Alexandria Eschate (\"The Furthest\") in modern Tajikistan. The campaign took Alexander through Media, Parthia, Aria (West Afghanistan), Drangiana, Arachosia (South and Central Afghanistan), Bactria (North and Central Afghanistan), and Scythia. Spitamenes, who held an undefined position in the satrapy of Sogdiana, in 329 BC betrayed Bessus to Ptolemy, one of Alexander's trusted companions, and Bessus was executed. However, when, at some point later, Alexander was on the Jaxartes dealing with an incursion by a horse nomad army, Spitamenes raised Sogdiana in revolt. Alexander personally defeated the Scythians at the Battle of Jaxartes and immediately launched a campaign against Spitamenes, defeating him in the Battle of Gabai.

Spitamenes, who held an undefined position in the satrapy of Sogdiana, in 329 BC betrayed Bessus to Ptolemy, one of Alexander's trusted companions, and Bessus was executed. However, when, at some point later, Alexander was on the Jaxartes dealing with an incursion by a horse nomad army, Spitamenes raised Sogdiana in revolt. Alexander personally defeated the Scythians at the Battle of Jaxartes and immediately launched a campaign against Spitamenes, defeating him in the Battle of Gabai. After the defeat, Spitamenes was killed by his own men, who then sued for peace.\n\nQuestion: What three things did Bessus and Spitamens have in common?", "answer": ""}

The Persian king no longer controlled his own destiny, and was taken prisoner by Bessus, his Bactrian satrap and kinsman. As Alexander approached, Bessus had his men fatally stab the Great King and then declared himself Darius' successor as Artaxerxes V, before retreating into Central Asia to launch a guerrilla campaign against Alexander. Alexander buried Darius' remains next to his Achaemenid predecessors in a regal funeral. He claimed that, while dying, Darius had named him as his successor to the Achaemenid throne. The Achaemenid Empire is normally considered to have fallen with Darius. Alexander viewed Bessus as a usurper and set out to defeat him.

{"question": "Several years have elapsed. Ben is in the office of a real estate lawyer in New York, as junior partner. All Mrs. Hamilton's business is in his hands, and it is generally thought that he will receive a handsome legacy from her eventually. Mrs. Barclay prefers to live in Pentonville, but Ben often visits her. Whenever he goes to Pentonville he never fails to call on Rose Gardiner, now a beautiful young lady of marriageable age. She has lost none of her partiality for Ben, and it is generally understood that they are engaged. I have reason to think that the rumor is correct and that Rose will change her name to Barclay within a year. Nothing could be more agreeable to Mrs. Barclay, who has long looked upon Rose as a daughter. Tom Davenport is now in the city, but his course is far from creditable. His father has more than once been compelled to pay his debts, and has angrily refused to do so again. In fact, he has lost a large part of his once handsome fortune, and bids fair to close his life in penury. Success has come to Ben because he deserved it, and well-merited retribution to Tom Davenport. Harvey Dinsmore, once given over to evil courses, has redeemed himself, and is a reputable business man in New York. Mrs. Hamilton still lives, happy in the success of her protege. Conrad and his mother have tried more than once to regain their positions in her household, but in vain. None of my young readers will pity them. They are fully rewarded for their treachery.\n\nQuestion: Why did Tom Davenport's father lose such a large chunk of his fortune?", "answer": ""}

{"question": "Fact: Hell is other people. Sure, the ship was spacious. We didn't pick up many passengers—just the select, special few, scattered here and there between the stars.

Me, I was singled out by Sarah, an unassuming forty-something lady with a glass of champagne in one hand and the arm of a scrawny but tall blond man in the other.

The plate, by the way, was already loaded with folded pieces of smoked pink fish, paprika-dusted deviled eggs, toothpicks stabbed through green vegetables and slices of cheese, and balls of meat smothered in a tomato-based sauce. Luxurious, even compared to the fare one would find in the high-class space stations and pleasure cruisers. Compared to what a mere engineer would get on your typical cargo ship, it was mouthwateringly, lip-smackingly gorgeous. I wondered if the food delivered to my quarters the past few days had been similarly amazing. I decided it couldn't have been. \"Liking the taste of the sweet life, eh?

The plate, by the way, was already loaded with folded pieces of smoked pink fish, paprika-dusted deviled eggs, toothpicks stabbed through green vegetables and slices of cheese, and balls of meat smothered in a tomato-based sauce.

{"question": "Three great battle cruisers had gone to the bottom--the _Queen Mary_, of 27,000 tons; the _Indefatigable_, of 18,750 tons, and the _Invincible_, of 17,250 tons.  Cruisers lost included the _Defense_, of 14,600 tons; the _Black Prince_; of 13,550 tons, and the _Warrior_, of 13,550 tons.  The giant battle cruiser _Marlborough,_ of 27,500 tons, had been badly damaged, as had the _Lion_ and other vessels.  The destroyers _Tipperary, Turbulent, Nestore, Alcaster, Fortune, Sparrow Hawk, Ardent_ and _Shark_ had been sunk.  Total losses ran high into the millions and in the number of men above 7,000.  The German losses had been less, but nevertheless, taking into consideration damage done to the effectiveness of the two fleets as a whole, the enemy had sustained the harder blow.  The British fleet still maintained control of the North Sea, while the Germans, because of their losses, had been deprived of a large part of the fighting strength of their fleet.  The British, in spite of their heavier losses, would recover more quickly than could the enemy.\n\nQuestion: What are the names of at least three different types of vessels used in the battle?", "answer": ""}

{"question": "During the short transition, Rice and Hadley concentrated on staffing and organizing the NSC. Their policy priorities differed from those of the Clinton administration. Those priorities included China, missile defense, the collapse of the Middle East peace process, and the Persian Gulf. Generally aware that terrorism had changed since the first Bush administration, they paid particular attention to the question of how counterterrorism policy should be coordinated. Rice had asked University of Virginia history professor Philip Zelikow to advise her on the transition. Hadley and Zelikow asked Clarke and his deputy, Roger Cressey, for a special briefing on the terrorist threat and how Clarke'sTransnationalThreats Directorate and Counterterrorism Security Group functioned. In the NSC during the first Bush administration, many tough issues were addressed at the level of the Deputies Committee. Issues did not go to the principals unless the deputies had been unable to resolve them. Presidential Decision Directive 62 of the Clinton administration had said specifically that Clarke's Counterterrorism Security Group should report through the Deputies Committee or, at Berger's discretion, directly to the principals. Berger had in practice allowed Clarke's group to function as a parallel deputies committee, reporting directly to those members of the Principals Committee who sat on the special Small Group. There, Clarke himself sat as a de facto principal. Rice decided to change the special structure that had been built to coordinate counterterrorism policy. It was important to sound policymaking, she felt, that Clarke's interagency committee-like all others-report to the principals through the deputies. Rice made an initial decision to hold over both Clarke and his entire counterterrorism staff, a decision that she called rare for a new administration. She decided also that Clarke should retain the title of national counterterrorism coordinator, although he would no longer be a de facto member of the Principals Committee on his issues. The decision to keep Clarke, Rice said, was \"not uncontroversial,\" since he was known as someone who \"broke China,\" but she and Hadley wanted an experienced crisis manager. No one else from Berger's staff had Clarke's detailed knowledge of the levers of government. 168 Clarke was disappointed at what he perceived as a demotion.\n\nQuestion: What were Rice and Hadley's policy priorities?", "answer": ""}

{"question": "Teams from the FBI, the Naval Criminal Investigative Service, and the CIA were immediately sent to Yemen to investigate the attack. With difficulty, Barbara Bodine, the U.S. ambassador to Yemen, tried to persuade the Yemeni government to accept these visitors and allow them to carry arms, though the Yemenis balked at letting Americans openly carry long guns (rifles, shotguns, automatic weapons). Meanwhile, Bodine and the leader of the FBI team, John O'Neill, clashed repeatedly-to the point that after O'Neill had been rotated out of Yemen but wanted to return, Bodine refused the request. Despite the initial tension, the Yemeni and American investigations proceeded. Within a few weeks, the outline of the story began to emerge. On the day of the Cole attack, a list of suspects was assembled that included al Qaeda's affiliate Egyptian Islamic Jihad. U.S. counterterrorism officials told us they immediately assumed that al Qaeda was responsible. But as Deputy DCI John McLaughlin explained to us, it was not enough for the attack to smell, look, and taste like an al Qaeda operation. To make a case, the CIA needed not just a guess but a link to someone known to be an al Qaeda operative. Within the first weeks after the attack, the Yemenis found and arrested both Badawi and Quso, but did not let the FBI team participate in the interrogations. The CIA described initial Yemeni support after the Cole as \"slow and inadequate.\" President Clinton, Secretary Albright, and DCI Tenet all intervened to help. Because the information was secondhand, the U.S. team could not make its own assessment of its reliability. On November 11, the Yemenis provided the FBI with new information from the interrogations of Badawi and Quso, including descriptions of individuals from whom the detainees had received operational direction. One of them was Khallad, who was described as having lost his leg. The detainees said that Khallad helped direct the Cole operation from Afghanistan or Pakistan. The Yemenis (correctly) judged that the man described as Khallad was Tawfiq bin Attash. An FBI special agent recognized the name Khallad and connected this news with information from an important al Qaeda source who had been meeting regularly with CIA and FBI officers.\n\nQuestion: After the initial tensions, what emerged after a few weeks?", "answer": ""}

The interview between Doctor Wallington and Flockley was a most affecting one. The dudish student broke down utterly, and confessed all. He said Koswell had hatched out the plot, aided by Larkspur, and that he himself had been a more or less unwilling participant. He told much about Parwick, and how that dissolute fellow had spoken of having the strange powder, which was a Japanese concoction, and which, if used often, would render a person insane.

He told much about Parwick, and how that dissolute fellow had spoken of having the strange powder, which was a Japanese concoction, and which, if used often, would render a person insane. He begged the good doctor to forgive him, and said he would be willing to do anything in order to remain at Brill.\n\nQuestion: Which student could be described as 'dudish'?", "answer": ""}
{"question": "Electricity can be very dangerous. To reduce the risk of injury, safety features are built into electric circuits and devices. You might have noticed some of these in your home. They include three-prong plugs, circuit breakers, and GFCI outlets. Each feature is described and illustrated in Table 1.4. Electric Safety Feature Three-Prong Plug Description A three-prong plug is generally used on metal appli- ances. The two flat prongs carry the current. The round prong is for safety. It connects with a wire inside the outlet. This wire connects to the ground. By redirecting the current it can pass into the ground. The ground is where it can be harmlessly absorbed. Circuit Breaker A circuit breaker is another safety feature. The circuit breaker automatically opens a circuit if too much current flows through it. This could happen if too many electric devices are plugged in. It can also happen if there is an electric short. Once the problem is resolved, the circuit breaker can be switched back on. Once switched back on, the circuit is closed.\n\nQuestion: What are the prongs for on A three-prong plug?", "answer": ""}

{"question": "Peace and Prosperity: After years of government propaganda predicting the worst atrocities, most Japanese civilians were surprised at the warmth and friendliness of the occupying forces. The postwar period began, however, with millions of displaced people homeless and starving. To counter a perceived communist threat from the Soviet Union, the US quickly set to work reconstructing the economy by transforming Japan’s institutions and devising a new pacifist constitution. Article 9 renounced Japan’s right to maintain armed forces, although the ambiguous wording was later taken to permit the creati on of a “self-defense” force. The zaibatsu conglomerates that had proved so instrumental in boosting Japan’s militarism were disbanded, later to re-emerge as the keiretsu trading conglomerates that dominated the economy once again. The entire economy received a massive jump-start with the outbreak of the Korean War, with Japan ironically becoming the chief local supplier for an army it had battled so furiously just a few years earlier. The occupation lasted until 1952, having already planted the seeds for Japan’s future stunning economic success. Economic output was back to prewar levels, and British auto companies provided the support needed to get Japan’s auto industry back on its feet. Japanese companies then enthusiastically imported any Western technologies they could get their hands on. This included transistor technology — invented in the US but then considered to have only limited applications — for the surreal sum of $25,000. It was Japan that produced the world’s first transistor radio. The electronic technology spurt that followed is now legendary. Parliamentary democracy finally came into its own, albeit with distinctly Japanese characteristics reflecting the dislike of debate and confrontation and the group-oriented preference for maintaining the appearance of harmony at all times. The government, through the powerful Finance Ministry and Ministry of International Trade and Industry, generously supported favored private corporations: first shipping, then cars, then electronics firms basked in the warmth of the government’s loving attentions. Japan overtook Britain economically in 1964. By the end of the decade, Japan’s was the third largest economy in the world — less then two decades after the war had left the country in ruins. Prosperity was not without its own problems: pollution caused by “dirty” industries, a high incidence of stomach ulcers (even suicides) among schoolchildren pressured by over-ambitious parents, and the awkward questions of what to do about nuclear energy. The famous coziness among politicians, bureaucrats, and private companies, together with the strong cultural emphasis on relationship-building and a lack of transparency and accountability, eventually led to corrupt practices of endemic proportions.\n\nQuestion: To create the world’s first transistor radio, Japan used technology originally founded in what country?", "answer": ""}

{"question": "Alexander's army crossed the Hellespont in 334 BC with approximately 48,100 soldiers, 6,100 cavalry and a fleet of 120 ships with crews numbering 38,000, drawn from Macedon and various Greek city-states, mercenaries, and feudally raised soldiers from Thrace, Paionia, and Illyria. (However, Arrian, who used Ptolemy as a source, said that Alexander crossed with more than 5,000 horse and 30,000 foot; Diodorus quoted the same totals, but listed 5,100 horse and 32,000 foot. Diodorus also referred to an advance force already present in Asia, which Polyaenus, in his Stratagems of War (5.44.4), said numbered 10,000 men.) He showed his intent to conquer the entirety of the Persian Empire by throwing a spear into Asian soil and saying he accepted Asia as a gift from the gods. This also showed Alexander's eagerness to fight, in contrast to his father's preference for diplomacy. After an initial victory against Persian forces at the Battle of the Granicus, on the 24 of Daisios (8 April 334 BC), Alexander accepted the surrender of the Persian provincial capital and treasury of Sardis; he then proceeded along the Ionian coast, granting autonomy and democracy to the cities. Miletos, held by Achaemenid forces, required a delicate siege operation, with Persian naval forces nearby. Further south, at Halicarnassus, in Caria, Alexander successfully waged his first large-scale siege, eventually forcing his opponents, the mercenary captain Memnon of Rhodes and the Persian satrap of Caria, Orontobates, to withdraw by sea. Alexander left the government of Caria to a member of the Hecatomnid dynasty, Ada, who adopted Alexander. From Halicarnassus, Alexander proceeded into mountainous Lycia and the Pamphylian plain, asserting control over all coastal cities to deny the Persians naval bases. From Pamphylia onwards the coast held no major ports and Alexander moved inland. At Termessos, Alexander humbled but did not storm the Pisidian city. At the ancient Phrygian capital of Gordium, Alexander \"undid\" the hitherto unsolvable Gordian Knot, a feat said to await the future \"king of Asia\". According to the story, Alexander proclaimed that it did not matter how the knot was undone and hacked it apart with his sword.\n\nQuestion: How did Alexander the Great undo the Gordian Knot?", "answer": ""}

{"question": "You can think about static electricity like a teeter-totter. Things are fine as long as they are balanced. The same can be said about electrons. Too many or too few can be shocking! Static electricity is all about that balance. Charges can build up through friction. Some materials freely give away electrons. Other items easily gain electrons. Have you ever rubbed your feet on a wool mat or carpet? Rubber soled shoes readily accept electrons. The wool carpet easily gives up electrons to the shoes. This combination provides for a large transfer of electrons. This buildup of electric charges is known as static electricity. Positive charges build up on the mat and negative charges build up on you. What happens when an object becomes charged? A material is likely to remain charged until it touches another object. Sometimes it will discharge if you just come close to another object. What comes next may be shocking.\n\nQuestion: What happens when you touch electricity?", "answer": ""}

{"question": "Einstein visited New York City for the first time on 2 April 1921, where he received an official welcome by Mayor John Francis Hylan, followed by three weeks of lectures and receptions. He went on to deliver several lectures at Columbia University and Princeton University, and in Washington he accompanied representatives of the National Academy of Science on a visit to the White House. On his return to Europe he was the guest of the British statesman and philosopher Viscount Haldane in London, where he met several renowned scientific, intellectual and political figures, and delivered a lecture at King's College. He also published an essay, \"My First Impression of the U.S.A.,\" in July 1921, in which he tried briefly to describe some characteristics of Americans, much as Alexis de Tocqueville did, who published his own impressions in Democracy in America (1835). For some of his observations, Einstein was clearly surprised: \"What strikes a visitor is the joyous, positive attitude to life . The American is friendly, self-confident, optimistic, and without envy.\" In 1922, his travels took him to Asia and later to Palestine, as part of a six-month excursion and speaking tour, as he visited Singapore, Ceylon and Japan, where he gave a series of lectures to thousands of Japanese. After his first public lecture, he met the emperor and empress at the Imperial Palace, where thousands came to watch. In a letter to his sons, Einstein described his impression of the Japanese as being modest, intelligent, considerate, and having a true feel for art. On his return voyage, he visited Palestine for 12 days in what would become his only visit to that region.

After his first public lecture, he met the emperor and empress at the Imperial Palace, where thousands came to watch. In a letter to his sons, Einstein described his impression of the Japanese as being modest, intelligent, considerate, and having a true feel for art. On his return voyage, he visited Palestine for 12 days in what would become his only visit to that region. Einstein was greeted as if he were a head of state, rather than a physicist, which included a cannon salute upon arriving at the home of the British high commissioner, Sir Herbert Samuel. During one reception, the building was stormed by people who wanted to see and hear him. In Einstein's talk to the audience, he expressed happiness that the Jewish people were beginning to be recognized as a force in the world.\n\nQuestion: Which of Einstein's visits was longer: the one to Palestine or the one to the United States?", "answer": ""}

{"question": "As a husband, father and tenant of a Grand Rapids public housing complex, Aubrey Robertson puts security at the top of his home priority list. Because of that, Robertson is all for a zero-tolerance drug law in force at Creston Plaza apartments on Grand Rapids' Northeast Side. That includes cases in which families may be evicted for the drug use of a single family member, even off the premises. Robertson sees it as a tool to keep his complex as clean and safe as possible. \"If there's one person (using drugs), that is a start,\" said Robertson, 52, a native of Jamaica. He has lived the past four years at Creston Plaza with his wife, Tammy, and his daughter, Precious, 3. In recent months, Robertson was pleased to see casual drug use at the complex diminish with the installation of security cameras. \"If there is a start, then there will be some other problem. I totally agree (if there is a drug link), get them out.\" Critics say the law -- argued Tuesday before the U.S. Supreme Court -- tramples on individual rights and harms the very people public housing authorities are supposed to help. \"It's basically one strike and you're out, and I think they went beyond what Congress intended,\" said Michael Chielens, executive director of Western Michigan Legal Services. \"Someone who had no knowledge or involvement in a criminal act is being punished. That's kind of a basic due process notion that we have had in our legal tradition for a long time.\" The case was brought by four Oakland, Calif., senior citizens, including 63-year-old great-grandmother Pearlie Rucker. They received eviction notices because of the drug use of relatives or caregivers. Rucker was ordered out because her mentally disabled daughter was caught with cocaine three blocks from the apartment she shared with her mother and other family members, court records show.

{"question": "Bones are the main organs of the skeletal system. In adults, the skeleton consists of a whopping 206 bones. Many of those bones are in your hands and feet. You can see many of the bones of the human skeleton in Figure 3.13. Have you thought about how your bones are connected together? There are actually two ways that bones are connected. The skeletal system includes cartilage and ligaments. Cartilage is tough and flexible. It covers the ends of bones where they meet. The gray sections in Figure A ligament is like a stretchy band. Ligaments connect your bones together. You can think of ligaments like rubber bands. Rubber bands are used to hold things together.

{"question": "There were others far more perturbed by that odd conjunction of diners than the puzzled host, who merely expected Mrs. Bates to belabor him with a rolling pin.  Mr. Siddle, for instance, had just closed his shop when the five met.  That is to say, the dark blue blind was drawn, but the door was ajar.  He came to the threshold, and watched the party until the bridge was neared, when one of them, looking back, might have seen him, so he stepped discreetly inside.  Being a non-interfering, self-contained man, he seemed to be rather irresolute.  But that condition passed quickly.

{"question": "The Italian authorities provided the FBI with information from wiretaps of Tokhtakhounov's home telephone, part of an investigation into his criminal activities. The FBI said explicit conversations about the scheme had been recorded between Tokhtakhounov and his conspirators, and between him and Anissina, who was born in Russia and skated for France, and her mother. The FBI cited a vivid conversation with Anissina's mother in which Tokhtakhounov assured her that even if her daughter \"falls, we will make sure she is No. 1.\" After the Winter Olympics, a French judge, Marie-Reine Le Gougne, was suspended by the International Skating Union for not reporting pressure she said was put on her by Didier Gailhaguet, president of the French Skating Federation, to vote for the Russian pairs team. She later recanted and said that Canadian officials had pressured her. The ISU later suspended Le Gougne and Gailhaguet for three years. The federal complaint did not describe the possibility of a wider conspiracy or any contact between Tokhtakhounov, or his unnamed co-conspirators, with Le Gougne. \"We have alleged no connection between this man with any officials other than with Russian federation officials,\" James B.

{"question": "Years back in a kingdom far away there lived a family in the woods. This family had always lived in the woods. Their father each day would travel into the woods and chop wood to take to the town. The mother spent her day cleaning and taking care of their home and her three children. The dad and his family had a good life. They never wanted for much. The three kids went to school and had many friends in the town. One day there came a nasty storm to the woods. This storm brought a lot of rain and flooded many areas in the city. Many homes were under water. The leader came to the dad and asked him to go out and cut some very large logs to place in the city to keep the water back. The logs would be used to build a wall. The dad took his kids and his wife into the woods and cut down the largest trees they could find. In the end the town was saved because of the wall and for their work the dad and his family were paid and could build a bigger home and had more children.\n\nQuestion: What did the father and mother do each day", "answer": ""}

{"question": "(CNN)Opening statements begin Tuesday in the trial of Kendrick Johnson's parents in a case growing increasingly controversial after reports that a Georgia judge had the media removed from his courtroom. Exactly what happened is unclear, as The Valdosta Daily Times reported that its reporter, a citizen journalist and two television reporters were escorted out of the courtroom by a Lowndes County Sheriff's Office deputy who said she was following State Court Judge Mark Mitchell's order and offered no further explanation. However, the Johnsons' attorney, Chevene King, said that only CNN affiliate WCTV-TV had its reporter booted from the courtroom. WCTV had no reporting to that effect on its website, nor did CNN affiliate WTXL-TV. A clerk in Mitchell's office referred questions to Lowndes County Clerk Beth Copeland Green, who had not returned messages as of late Tuesday afternoon. Mitchell, a judge from Thomas County, is presiding over the case after Lowndes County Superior Court judges recused themselves from all proceedings involving the Johnsons in order to maintain fairness. Johnson's mother and father, along with five other relatives, are in court on misdemeanor charges related to a 2013 protest. Jury selection wrapped up Monday, and opening statements were scheduled to begin at 9 a.m. Tuesday. One black juror and five whites compose the six-man jury, WCTV reported. The alternate is also black, the station said. The \"KJ 7,\" as the defendants are known, each face a charge of interference with government property for allegedly blocking the entrance to the Lowndes County Courthouse in Valdosta and blocking access to the security checkpoint inside the building. The demonstration was planned after Johnson's parents became frustrated with the lack of information they had received from local investigators regarding their son, who was found dead inside a rolled gym mat at his South Georgia high school in January 2013, King said. Footage published on YouTube shows authorities arresting family members who held hands, blocking a door to the courthouse. Another video posted to a Kendrick Johnson tribute page on Facebook shows family members later, inside the courthouse, joining hands in front of the checkpoint. The family and others can be heard chanting, \"No justice, no peace,\" as officers step in to arrest them.\n\nQuestion: What is happening on Monday and Tuesday regarding the case?", "answer": ""}

Another video posted to a Kendrick Johnson tribute page on Facebook shows family members later, inside the courthouse, joining hands in front of the checkpoint. The family and others can be heard chanting, \"No justice, no peace,\" as officers step in to arrest them.\n\nQuestion: Johnson's mother, father and five other relatives are on trial and all the judges in Lowndes County recused themselves from the case, so what county is the judge from?", "answer": ""}
{"question": "(CNN) -- Since the bombing of the Boston marathon -- in which three people, including a child, were killed and more than 200 injured -- attention has naturally focused on what could have been done to prevent it. Some, such as Rep. Peter King, the New York Republican who chairs the Homeland Security Committee, have argued for increased surveillance of Muslims in the United States. Local police departments \"have to realize that the threat is coming from the Muslim community and increase surveillance there,\" he says. Others have asked whether leads were properly followed and if better sharing of information between agencies would have helped thwart the bombing. However, the government, with its $40 billion annual intelligence budget, already amasses vast quantities of information on the private lives of Muslims in the United States. The FBI has 3,000 intelligence analysts working on counterterrorism and 15,000 paid informants, according to Mother Jones. Exactly how many of them are focused on Muslims in the United States is unknown; there is little transparency in this area. But, given the emphasis the FBI has placed on preventing Muslim terrorism, and based on my interviews with FBI agents working on counterterrorism, there could be as many as two-thirds assigned to spying on Muslims. Taking the usual estimate of the Muslim population in the United States of 2.35 million, this would mean the FBI has a spy for every 200 Muslims in the United States. When one adds the resources of the National Security Agency, regional intelligence fusion centers, and the counterterrorism work of local police departments, such as the New York Police Department (where a thousand officers are said to work on counterterrorism and intelligence), the number of spies per Muslim may increase dramatically. East Germany's communist-era secret police, the Stasi, had one intelligence analyst or informant for every 66 citizens. This suggests that Muslims in the United States could be approaching levels of state surveillance similar to that which the East German population faced from the Stasi. Yet, as the Stasi itself eventually discovered, no system of surveillance can ever produce total knowledge of a population. Indeed, the greater the amount of information collected, the harder it is to interpret its meaning. In the majority of terrorist attacks in recent years, the relevant information was somewhere in the government's systems, but its significance was lost amid a morass of useless data. What is obscured by the demands for ever greater surveillance and information processing is that security is best established through relationships of trust and inclusion within the community. The real missed opportunity to intervene before the bombs went off in Boston likely came three months earlier, when bombing suspect Tamerlan Tsarnaev stood up during a Friday prayer service at his mosque - the Islamic Society of Boston, in Cambridge - to angrily protest the imam's sermon. The imam had been celebrating the life of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., which Tsarnaev thought was selling out.\n\nQuestion: Who are being blamed for the Boston marathon bombing?", "answer": ""}

Hall, an Ohio Democrat and one of very few U.S. congressmen to visit Iraq since the 1991 Gulf War over Kuwait, is scheduled to embark Sunday the 12-hour overland trip to the Iraqi capital, Baghdad. He did not speak to reporters in Jordan, but he told The Associated Press before leaving the United States that he hopes to \"separate the humanitarian work from the political issues.\" During his four days in Iraq, Hall said he wanted to investigate reports from relief agencies that a quarter of Iraqi children may be suffering from chronic malnutrition. He said he would pay particular attention to what happens to food and medicine entering the country under the U.N. oil-for-food program. If supplies are not reaching the people who need them, Hall said, he wanted to find out whether the United Nations or relief agencies needed to handle things differently, or whether \"Iraq needs to get out of the way and let us do the job.\" The Iraqi government blames the embargo for the malnutrition, infant mortality and other hardships. The sanctions cannot be lifted until U.N. inspectors certify that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction and the means to produce them.

{"question": "(CNN) -- A gas explosion ripped through a building containing offices and an art gallery in a historic district of central Prague on Monday morning, injuring 35 people and prompting evacuations of nearby buildings in the Czech capital, officials said. More than 230 people were evacuated from the area, including from buildings used by schools including Charles University and the Academy of Performing Arts' film and TV school, known as FAMU, officials said. \"We can now confirm this was a gas explosion. It was not a terrorist attack,\" Prague Mayor Bohuslav Svoboda told reporters Monday. The blast at 5 Divadelni Street, not far from the National Theatre and a block from the Vltava River, which cuts through the city, collapsed the first floor's ceiling, officials said. Windows in neighboring buildings were damaged. Officials do not believe anyone is trapped in the rubble, though fire officials will remain at the site for a while longer \"to be 100% sure nobody is in there,\" Svoboda said. People who initially were unaccounted for were later found with minor injuries, he said Of the 35 people injured, 30 were taken to hospitals, including two people who suffered serious injuries, officials with the city's emergency services said. The city's fire department, which is examining the area for possible gas leaks, said it would take two days to stabilize the site. Charles University canceled classes at an adjacent building for the rest of Monday. A surveyor employed by the city told reporters Monday that the building might not need to be demolished and that the damage appears to be reparable. Earlier, Czech news media gave conflicting reports of the building's location, with an outlet reporting at one point that the blast happened at a FAMU building. FAMU dean Pavel Jech said that the blast happened near FAMU's main building, known as Lazansky Palace, which was evacuated.\n\nQuestion: What is the name of the main building of the Academy of Performing Arts film and TV school?", "answer": ""}

{"question": "It might have seemed like manna from heaven - up to thousands of dollars dropping, often unexpectedly, into the hands of a half-million Kentucky and Indiana residents this month. But for some recipients, there is a downside to the checks from Anthem Inc., issued to policyholders as part of the insurer's conversion to a publicly traded company. The poorest recipients could actually suffer from the windfall by losing their benefits under Medicaid, food-stamp and other programs. That's because they suddenly have more money than the eligibility threshold for aid. TO avoid losing valuable benefits such as a Medicaid-paid spot in a nursing home, recipients may need to spend their money fast - as early as the end of this month - but make sure they do it in a way that meets program guidelines. \"You would think money out of the blue would be a good thing,\" said Jaime Odle Harmon, executive director of the Lexington-based Access to Justice Foundation. \"We're just trying to make sure that it is, and doesn't have a negative impact on low-income folks and their families.\" Legal aid lawyers in Kentucky have put together an action team and held frequent statewide conference calls in response to concerns from aid recipients and advocates that the Anthem payouts could cost people their benefits, at least temporarily. \"We're getting deluged\" with calls on the issue, said Hamon, whose agency supports the state's legal-services programs and operates a legal hotline for the elderly. The basic advice is this: if you received a check or stock from Anthem and you haven't disposed of it yet, pick up the phone and call a legal-aid lawyer, benefits counselor or someone else who understands eligibility guidelines. And do it right away. \"There are people out there who are available to help anyone who has a problem. It's legal service and it's free,\" said Amy Turner, a staff attorney in Louisville with the Legal Aid Society, which covers Jefferson and 14 surrounding counties. The sudden concern over losing benefits was triggered by the recent mailing by Anthem, the Indianapolis-based insurer, of about $2 billion in checks, plus shares of stock worth a bit more than that, to 1 million eligible policyholders in four states. About half of those were individuals or employers in Kentucky and Indiana. The distribution was a result of Anthem's conversion last year from a mutual company, owned by its policyholders, to a publicly traded company owned by the shareholders. Despite earlier mailings from Anthem, the checks caught many people by surprise. And while it was generally a nice surprise, it worried many aid-recipients who fear losing benefits - especially elderly residents in Medicaid nursing-home beds.\n\nQuestion: People in Kentucky and Indiana were surprised to receive what?", "answer": ""}

{"question": "Prairie State Legal Services Inc. of Peoria managing attorney Lisa Y. Wilson vows that poor central Illinoisans will continue to have free lawyers to assist them, despite funding cuts. \"There has been a decrease in funding to this Prairie State Legal office by about $50,000,\" Wilson said Thursday. \"That means that we will lose money to supply one attorney, but we should be able to continue to manage. It's not having the impact as it is having in Chicago\" and at other agencies statewide. Wilson's office, at 331 Fulton St., Suite 600, serves poor residents in the counties of Peoria, Tazewell, Woodford, Marshall and Stark. Wilson learned from Eric Kleiman, a spokesman for Legal Services Corp. - the Washington, D.C.-based agency that distributes federal money for free legal aid programs in Illinois - that LSC will lose about $920,000 in congressional funding annually. Besides Prairie State, LSC also funds the Legal Assistance Foundation of Metropolitan Chicago, and Alton-based Land of Lincoln Legal Services. The cuts will take the biggest bite out of Land of Lincoln, a network of eight offices and 40 lawyers who help clients in southern Illinois with problems such as eviction, access to Social Security and obtaining orders of protection from abusive spouses, Kleiman said. The LSC allocates money to states based on the number of poor counted in the last census. The 2000 census showed Illinois with about 35,000 fewer people who are eligible for LSC services. Although the three groups deliver most of the legal aid in Illinois, dozens of other programs offer similar services, and all will feel the pain when the Lawyers Trust Fund of Illinois doles out grants for 2003. The fund, created by the Illinois Supreme Court in 1983, gets interest from escrow accounts and other money lawyers often keep for their clients and spends it on legal aid. This year, the fund will likely award just half of the $3.5 million it usually gives some 34 groups statewide, said Ruth Ann Schmitt, the trust funds executive director. The Illinois General Assembly has appropriated about $500,000 annually for legal aid in recent years, an amount Bartylak said has not been much reduced. Still, of the nation's 10 most populated states, Illinois ranks last in the amount of money legislators appropriate for legal aid, LSC President John Erlenborn said earlier this year. Peoria County State's Attorney Kevin Lyons said all the budget cuts will not affect poor criminals because the state court appoints public defenders.\n\nQuestion: What three groups deliver most of the legal aid in Illinois?", "answer": ""}

Peoria County State's Attorney Kevin Lyons said all the budget cuts will not affect poor criminals because the state court appoints public defenders.\n\nQuestion: What is the full name of the managing attorney that works at 331 Fulton St., Suite 600?", "answer": ""}

{"question": "For more than half a century, the Passaic County Legal Aid Society has fought on behalf of the county's poor, in disputes ranging from housing to child custody to public assistance. But for the last several years it has often done that job poorly, according to state and federal officials. And barring a long-shot legal victory, as of Jan. 1 the autonomous county office will be replaced by a new agency whose administrators will report to a director based in Jersey City. Federal legal aid officials drew up the new service area uniting Bergen, Hudson, and Passaic counties in June, insisting the change will trim administrative costs without compromising services. The Passaic County office and its supporters see it differently. They say top decision-makers will be too far from the individuals and non-profit agencies that rely on the office for help. And in a federal lawsuit, the agency's leadership argues that a merger would jeopardize its educational programs and minority hiring efforts, and that its imposition amounts to bureaucratic bullying by state and federal officials. Those same officials have repeatedly accused the Passaic County office of mismanagement. Reviews since 1995 have found evidence of shoddy accounting, poor morale, excessive staff turnover, and double counting of cases - and alleged that the office made limited efforts to rectify the problems. At times in recent years, the office has received its state and federal funding on a month-to-month basis, which one federal official called \"one step short of defunding.\" Leaders of the county agency, which employs 14 attorneys, five paralegals, and nine support staff at offices in Paterson and Wanaque, say officials have \"greatly exaggerated\" the office's problems, which they call mostly bureaucratic. \"Just let them argue that their [merger] plan makes sense,\" Maxim Thorne, the office's deputy director, said of the higher-level legal aid officials. \"They could never replicate our services or equal the accumulated value of this office.\" Over the summer, the office reapplied for a federal grant to serve Passaic County in the coming year. But Legal Services Corp. in Washington rejected the application, saying it failed to address the service needs of the entire tri-county area - a requirement under the new rules. By mid-December, the federal body is expected to award Passaic County's federal funding - about $385,000 this year - to Northeast New Jersey Legal Services, the tri-county agency. State funds of about $1.6 million could follow, although Thorne noted the state appropriated $927,000 of that amount through June 2003. The state Treasury Department's legal services representative did not return repeated calls for comment.\n\nQuestion: What services does the Passaic County Legal Aid Society provide?", "answer": ""}

{"question": "From a curious scholar's lore he drew fantastics with which to torment his victim.  We heard of all the witches, warlocks, incubi, succibi, harpies, devils, imps, and haunters of Avitchi, from all the teachings of history, sacred and profane, Hindu, Egyptian, Greek, mediaeval, Swedenborg, Rosicrucian, theosophy, theology, with every last ounce of horror, mystery, shivers, and creeps squeezed out of them.  They were gorgeous ghost stories, for they were told by a man fully informed as to all the legendary and gruesome details.  At first I used to think he might have communicated it more effectively.  Then I saw that the cool, drawling manner, the level voice, were in reality the highest art.  He told his stories in a half-amused, detached manner which imposed confidence more readily than any amount of earnest asseveration.  The mere fact of his own belief in what he said came to matter little.  He was the vehicle by which was brought accurate knowledge.  He had read all these things, and now reported them as he had read: each man could decide for himself as to their credibility.\n\nQuestion: Why is the storyteller fully informed on the details of his stories?", "answer": ""}

{"question": "Waves are the way energy travels through matter. Ocean waves are energy traveling through water. They form when wind blows over the surface of the ocean. Wind energy is transferred to the sea surface. Then, the energy is carried through the water by the waves. Figure 2.52 shows ocean waves crashing against rocks on a shore. They pound away at the rocks and anything else they strike. Three factors determine the size of ocean waves: 1. The speed of the wind 2. The length of time the wind blows 3. The distance the wind blows The faster, longer, and farther the wind blows, the bigger the waves are. Bigger waves have more energy.\n\nQuestion: What does the article teach us about big waves?", "answer": ""}

Wind energy is transferred to the sea surface. Then, the energy is carried through the water by the waves. Figure 2.52 shows ocean waves crashing against rocks on a shore. They pound away at the rocks and anything else they strike. Three factors determine the size of ocean waves: 1. The speed of the wind 2. The length of time the wind blows 3. The distance the wind blows The faster, longer, and farther the wind blows, the bigger the waves are. Bigger waves have more energy.\n\nQuestion: What determines the size of ocean waves?", "answer": ""}

{"question": "When he turned 13 he discovered the violin sonatas of Mozart, whereupon \"Einstein fell in love\" with Mozart's music and studied music more willingly. He taught himself to play without \"ever practicing systematically\", he said, deciding that \"love is a better teacher than a sense of duty.\" At age 17, he was heard by a school examiner in Aarau as he played Beethoven's violin sonatas, the examiner stating afterward that his playing was \"remarkable and revealing of 'great insight'.\" What struck the examiner, writes Botstein, was that Einstein \"displayed a deep love of the music, a quality that was and remains in short supply. Music possessed an unusual meaning for this student.\" Music took on a pivotal and permanent role in Einstein's life from that period on. Although the idea of becoming a professional himself was not on his mind at any time, among those with whom Einstein played chamber music were a few professionals, and he performed for private audiences and friends. Chamber music had also become a regular part of his social life while living in Bern, Zurich, and Berlin, where he played with Max Planck and his son, among others. He is sometimes erroneously credited as the editor of the 1937 edition of the Kochel catalogue of Mozart's work; that edition was actually prepared by Alfred Einstein. In 1931, while engaged in research at the California Institute of Technology, he visited the Zoellner family conservatory in Los Angeles, where he played some of Beethoven and Mozart's works with members of the Zoellner Quartet. Near the end of his life, when the young Juilliard Quartet visited him in Princeton, he played his violin with them, and the quartet was \"impressed by Einstein's level of coordination and intonation.\"\n\nQuestion: How many years passed between the time Einstein discovered the sonatas of Mozart and when he was heard playing in Aarau?", "answer": ""}

Both sides are in talks to settle the dispute.\n\nQuestion: Who currently impedes the company Sony wants to run the new studio?", "answer": ""}
{"question": "Like flowing water, flowing ice erodes the land. It also can deposit the material elsewhere. Glaciers cause erosion in two main ways: plucking and abrasion. Plucking is caused when sediments are picked up by a glacier. They freeze to the bottom of the glacier and are carried away by the flowing ice. Abrasion occurs when glaciers scrape over the Earths surface. The ice sheet acts like sandpaper. The ice contains sediments and rocks frozen in the ice. The rocks and sediment grind away as the glacier moves. They wear away rock. They may also leave scratches and grooves in them. Scientists use these grooves to learn about the direction the glacier has moved.\n\nQuestion: How does the ice sheet act like sandpaper?", "answer": ""}

{"question": "The eviction of three Lynchburg women and four children last summer, partly as a result of a \"rent-to-own\" contract, has drawn the attention of the General Assembly. But a bill drafted by Del. Preston Bryant, R-Lynchburg, won't be addressed until next year after the Virginia Housing Commission, prompted by a Senate Joint Resolution, offers its recommendations based on a statewide study of rent-to-own contracts and other housing issues. Bryant said he read about the issue in a July News & Advance editorial. The editorial stemmed from a News & Advance article which highlighted three women and four children who were being evicted after their home at 1328 Bedford Ave., was cited for two dozen code violations. The women had been paying $425 a month in a rent-to-own agreement for five years, or roughly $25,500. They still had another 10 years to go to complete the contract. \"I called the Virginia Legal Aid Society and also talked to (City Attorney) Walter Erwin and (Housing Authority executive director) Ed McCann about it,\" Bryant said Monday. \"I asked them to take a look at this issue as an ad hoc committee.\" \"I was a little concerned about it and wanted to see if there was any reasonable steps that could be taken to help protect folks that are not overly burdensome.\" Bryant's bill, House Bill 1122, requires all rent-to-own contracts to be recorded in the land deeds where the property is located along with any documents indicating the financial arrangement. It also requires landlords to have their property inspected prior to tenants signing a rent-to-own contract and to provide the tenant with the inspection report. \"Many times, those entering into these contracts are your less sophisticated people,\" Bryant said. \"And while I don't think we as a government can protect everybody we can take some steps to help protect people.\" Lawyers say the rent-to-own contracts are legal but the contracts do tend to take advantage of people with limited options. \"We always tell people not to sign those,\" said Renae Patrick, managing attorney at Lynchburg's Virginia Legal Aid Society, in a June 27, 2001 article about rent-to-own contracts.

{"question": "Wanderjahre and marriage (1490-94) After completing his term of apprenticeship, Durer followed the common German custom of taking Wanderjahre--in effect gap years --in which the apprentice learned skills from artists in other areas; Durer was to spend about four years away. He left in 1490, possibly to work under Martin Schongauer, the leading engraver of Northern Europe, but who died shortly before Durer's arrival at Colmar in 1492. It is unclear where Durer travelled in the intervening period, though it is likely that he went to Frankfurt and the Netherlands. In Colmar, Durer was welcomed by Schongauer's brothers, the goldsmiths Caspar and Paul and the painter Ludwig. In 1493 Durer went to Strasbourg, where he would have experienced the sculpture of Nikolaus Gerhaert. Durer's first painted self-portrait (now in the Louvre) was painted at this time, probably to be sent back to his fiancee in Nuremberg. In early 1492 Durer travelled to Basel to stay with another brother of Martin Schongauer, the goldsmith Georg. Very soon after his return to Nuremberg, on 7 July 1494, at the age of 23, Durer was married to Agnes Frey following an arrangement made during his absence.

{"question": "The Vikings Arrive. Throughout this period, Ireland's political organization continued much as it had under pagan Celtic rule. There were still no towns; the site of Dublin was only a crossroads, known as Baile Atha Cliath (\"City of the Hurdles,\" a designation still seen on buses). Communities clustered around monasteries and castles. From a.d. 795, Ireland was subject to repeated Viking raids. The Vikings sacked the great centers of learning for their treasures. In the ninth century they built a fort on the Liffey and founded Ireland's first town — Dubh Linn or \"Black Pool.\" The remains of Viking fortifications can be seen today beneath Dublin Castle. The Vikings also introduced coinage and better ship-building techniques. In a.d. 988 the Irish kings finally united under the king of Munster, Brian Ború, and in a great battle drove the Vikings north of the Liffey. Their influence waned, and they began to be absorbed into the general population. The Irish now held Dublin and in 1038 the first Christ Church Cathedral was founded. Ireland Under the Normans In 1169 the Normans landed in Wexford, beginning the struggle between England and Ireland that was to dominate Irish history until independence. Norman incursion began with an internal power struggle. The king of Leinster invited Richard de Clare, known as \"Strongbow,\" to come to Ireland to help him reclaim his kingdom (Strongbow's tomb can be seen in Christ Church Cathedral).

{"question": "Philips Andover Academy, one of the most elite and selective boarding high schools in the country, failed again to elect a girl to its top student position -- the school presidency. Since the school went co-ed in 1973, only three girls have held this office. In a letter that launched a fiery debate across its campus, senior girls implored their peers to look hard at the school's \"staggering gender imbalance\" in student leadership. Headmaster John Palfrey responded by telling The New York Times, \"Girls have not had equal access to top leadership positions.\" Yet, access for girls is rarely the problem when it comes to pursuing leadership. Feeling authorized to take leadership roles is the problem. It starts early. From childhood to adolescence, girls face mixed messages about displaying power and authority. The girls at Andover and elsewhere are socialized to be likeable, to please others, to not tout their own successes and to speak softly like proper girls. As a result, they face powerful psychological barriers to attaining leadership roles. The impact of what I call the \"curse of the good girl\" effect first appears in friendships, when young girls take pains to avoid direct conflict with peers. \"I want to tell her how I feel,\" a typical girl would say in my research interviews, \"but what if she hates me or turns other people against me?\" These girls often resorted to gossip and other forms of indirect communication, or they internalize their feelings in unhealthy ways. Over time, pretending not to be angry with a friend when you are, or turning to a text messages instead of having an honest conversation, becomes a formative habit of communication.

Feeling authorized to take leadership roles is the problem. It starts early. From childhood to adolescence, girls face mixed messages about displaying power and authority. The girls at Andover and elsewhere are socialized to be likeable, to please others, to not tout their own successes and to speak softly like proper girls. As a result, they face powerful psychological barriers to attaining leadership roles. The impact of what I call the \"curse of the good girl\" effect first appears in friendships, when young girls take pains to avoid direct conflict with peers. \"I want to tell her how I feel,\" a typical girl would say in my research interviews, \"but what if she hates me or turns other people against me?\" These girls often resorted to gossip and other forms of indirect communication, or they internalize their feelings in unhealthy ways. Over time, pretending not to be angry with a friend when you are, or turning to a text messages instead of having an honest conversation, becomes a formative habit of communication. Meanwhile, the muscles that girls need to assert their strongest feelings and opinions atrophy. By the time girls join sports teams and school organizations, many have imported these social habits into student leadership contexts.\n\nQuestion: What choices do girls often make to avoid conflict when they are young and that often become habits that are detrimental to leadership?", "answer": ""}

{"question": "At 9:34, Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport advised the Secret Service of an unknown aircraft heading in the direction of the White House. American 77 was then 5 miles west-southwest of the Pentagon and began a 330-degree turn. At the end of the turn, it was descending through 2,200 feet, pointed toward the Pentagon and downtown Washington. The hijacker pilot then advanced the throttles to maximum power and dove toward the Pentagon. At 9:37:46, American Airlines Flight 77 crashed into the Pentagon, traveling at approximately 530 miles per hour. All on board, as well as many civilian and military personnel in the building, were killed. The Battle for United 93 At 8:42, United Airlines Flight 93 took off from Newark (New Jersey) Liberty International Airport bound for San Francisco. The aircraft was piloted by Captain Jason Dahl and First Officer Leroy Homer, and there were five flight attendants. Thirty-seven passengers, including the hijackers, boarded the plane. Scheduled to depart the gate at 8:00, the Boeing 757's takeoff was delayed because of the airport's typically heavy morning traffic. The hijackers had planned to take flights scheduled to depart at 7:45 (American 11), 8:00 (United 175 and United 93), and 8:10 (American 77). Three of the flights had actually taken off within 10 to 15 minutes of their planned departure times. United 93 would ordinarily have taken off about 15 minutes after pulling away from the gate. When it left the ground at 8:42, the flight was running more than 25 minutes late. As United 93 left Newark, the flight's crew members were unaware of the hijacking of American 11. Around 9:00, the FAA, American, and United were facing the staggering realization of apparent multiple hijackings. At 9:03, they would see another aircraft strike the World Trade Center.

{"question": "ROME, Italy (CNN) -- A U.N. report says hunger is on the rise globally and blames higher food prices. Populations within conflict zones such as the Democratic Republic of Congo are particularly vulnerable. The Food and Agriculture Organization has issued preliminary estimates classifying 963 million people as undernourished -- an increase of 40 million people over the past year. \"One out of seven people -- about 15 percent -- suffer chronically of not having enough to eat,\" said Mark Smulders, an FAO economist. The hunger report -- titled \"The State of Food Insecurity in the World 2008\" -- said the world's financial and economic problems could throw more people into poverty. The number of hungry had been increasing over the years before the rise in food prices, with warfare and political instability continuing to be among the factors causing poverty. The preliminary estimates lack a firm country breakdown, but last year's figures are an accurate measure of where the problems are. About 907 out of 923 million undernourished people in 2007, or 65 percent of the hungry, live in India, China, the war-wracked Democratic Republic of Congo, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Pakistan and Ethiopia. Smulders said about 27 percent of the world's hungry live in India and 15 percent in China. The other countries each represent 4 to 5 percent of the world's total.

The preliminary estimates lack a firm country breakdown, but last year's figures are an accurate measure of where the problems are. About 907 out of 923 million undernourished people in 2007, or 65 percent of the hungry, live in India, China, the war-wracked Democratic Republic of Congo, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Pakistan and Ethiopia. Smulders said about 27 percent of the world's hungry live in India and 15 percent in China. The other countries each represent 4 to 5 percent of the world's total.

So does the ground beneath your feet. In fact, everything you can see and touch is made of matter. The only things that are not matter are forms of energy. This would include things such as light and sound. Although forms of energy are not matter, the air and other substances they travel through are. So what is matter? Matter is defined as anything that has mass and volume. You may recall that atoms are the building blocks of matter. Even things as small as atoms have mass and volume. The more atoms, or matter, the more mass and volume are present. Different types of atoms have different amounts of mass and volume. So, its not enough to know the count of atoms to determine the mass. You must also know the type of atoms an item is made of.

The more atoms, or matter, the more mass and volume are present. Different types of atoms have different amounts of mass and volume. So, its not enough to know the count of atoms to determine the mass. You must also know the type of atoms an item is made of. Mass and volume are just two ways to describe the physical property of a substance. Physical properties are all determined by the amounts and type of atoms that compose items.\n\nQuestion: What is necessary to determine mass?", "answer": ""}

{"question": "Alexander III of Macedon (20/21 July 356 - 10/11 June 323 BC), commonly known as Alexander the Great (Greek: Alexandros o Megas, Alexandros ho Megas [a.lek.san.dros ho me.gas]), was a King (Basileus) of the Ancient Greek kingdom of Macedon and a member of the Argead dynasty. Born in Pella in 356 BC, Alexander succeeded his father, Philip II, to the throne at the age of twenty. He spent most of his ruling years on an unprecedented military campaign through Asia and northeast Africa, until by the age of thirty he had created one of the largest empires of the ancient world, stretching from Greece to Egypt and into northwest India. He was undefeated in battle and is considered one of history's most successful military commanders. During his youth, Alexander was tutored by the philosopher Aristotle until the age of 16. After Philip was assassinated in 336 BC, Alexander succeeded his father to the throne and inherited a strong kingdom and an experienced army. He had been awarded the generalship of Greece and used this authority to launch his father's Panhellenic project to lead the Greeks in the conquest of Persia. In 334 BC, he invaded the Achaemenid Empire, ruled Asia Minor, and began a series of campaigns that lasted ten years. Alexander broke the power of Persia in a series of decisive battles, most notably the battles of Issus and Gaugamela. He subsequently overthrew the Persian King Darius III and conquered the Achaemenid Empire in its entirety. At that point, his empire stretched from the Adriatic Sea to the Indus River. Seeking to reach the \"ends of the world and the Great Outer Sea\", he invaded India in 326 BC, but was eventually forced to turn back at the demand of his troops. Alexander died in Babylon in 323 BC, the city he planned to establish as his capital, without executing a series of planned campaigns that would have begun with an invasion of Arabia. In the years following his death, a series of civil wars tore his empire apart, resulting in several states ruled by the Diadochi, Alexander's surviving generals and heirs. Alexander's legacy includes the cultural diffusion his conquests engendered, such as Greco-Buddhism. He founded some twenty cities that bore his name, most notably Alexandria in Egypt. Alexander's settlement of Greek colonists and the resulting spread of Greek culture in the east resulted in a new Hellenistic civilization, aspects of which were still evident in the traditions of the Byzantine Empire in the mid-15th century and the presence of Greek speakers in central and far eastern Anatolia until the 1920s. Alexander became legendary as a classical hero in the mold of Achilles, and he features prominently in the history and myth of Greek and non-Greek cultures.\n\nQuestion: Where did the city Alexandria, Egypt get its name from?", "answer": ""}

{"question": "Arthur Weldon had not been very enthusiastic about the paper at any time, although he humored the girls by attending in a good-natured way to the advertising, hiring some of the country folk to get subscriptions, and keeping the books.  He was a young man of considerable education who had inherited a large fortune, safely invested, and therefore had no need, through financial necessity, to interest himself in business of any sort.  He allowed the girls to print his name as editor in chief, but he did no editorial work at all, amusing himself these delightful summer days by wandering in the woods, where he collected botanical specimens, or sitting with Uncle John on the lawn, where they read together or played chess.  Both the men were glad the girls were happy in their work and enthusiastic over the success of their audacious venture.  Beth was developing decided talent as a writer of editorials and her articles were even more thoughtful and dignified than were those of Patsy.  The two girls found plenty to occupy them at the office, while Louise did the reportorial work and flitted through Millville and down to Huntingdon each day in search of small items of local interest.  She grew fond of this work, for it brought her close to the people and enabled her to study their characters and peculiarities.

{"question": "After graduating, Einstein spent almost two frustrating years searching for a teaching post. He acquired Swiss citizenship in February 1901, but was not conscripted for medical reasons. With the help of Marcel Grossmann's father Einstein secured a job in Bern at the Federal Office for Intellectual Property, the patent office, as an assistant examiner. He evaluated patent applications for a variety of devices including a gravel sorter and an electromechanical typewriter. In 1903, Einstein's position at the Swiss Patent Office became permanent, although he was passed over for promotion until he \"fully mastered machine technology\". Much of his work at the patent office related to questions about transmission of electric signals and electrical-mechanical synchronization of time, two technical problems that show up conspicuously in the thought experiments that eventually led Einstein to his radical conclusions about the nature of light and the fundamental connection between space and time. With a few friends he had met in Bern, Einstein started a small discussion group, self-mockingly named \"The Olympia Academy\", which met regularly to discuss science and philosophy. Their readings included the works of Henri Poincare, Ernst Mach, and David Hume, which influenced his scientific and philosophical outlook.\n\nQuestion: Which event happend after others?", "answer": ""}

With a few friends he had met in Bern, Einstein started a small discussion group, self-mockingly named \"The Olympia Academy\", which met regularly to discuss science and philosophy.

{"question": "In Italy, he returned to painting, at first producing a series of works executed in tempera on linen. These include portraits and altarpieces, notably, the Paumgartner altarpiece and the Adoration of the Magi. In early 1506, he returned to Venice and stayed there until the spring of 1507. By this time Durer's engravings had attained great popularity and were being copied. In Venice he was given a valuable commission from the emigrant German community for the church of San Bartolomeo. This was the altar-piece known as the Adoration of the Virgin or the Feast of Rose Garlands. It includes portraits of members of Venice's German community, but shows a strong Italian influence. It was subsequently acquired by the Emperor Rudolf II and taken to Prague.

{"question": "(CNN) -- Eight-year-old Tineyi takes my hand and leads me into her mud-thatched hut in my home village of Matau in rural Zimbabwe. There, in a dark corner of the room, is a wooden bookshelf. Carefully crafted by her father, it protects her word-filled treasures from the smoky fire inside the small hut where her mother cooks. I smile, knowing that her father has recognized the value these books will bring to his little bookworm -- a life ahead of her with limitless opportunities. It was not a life intended for many girls in Africa. As a cattle-herding tomboy, I was bound to follow in the footsteps of generations of women before me: early marriage, illiteracy and poverty. Back then, most kids in my village never had a chance to attend pre-school because it didn't exist. Instead, we would spend hours chasing birds and monkeys from our parents' fields. Gold mines and urban factories employed men, while women remained at home to look after their children. The more men could read and write, the better their chances of being employed and able to provide for their family. As a result, families wanted to educate their sons, who became village role models. Without an education, how could girls compete? How could they become role models, too? That was more than 40 years ago. Today, change is happening in my beloved Matau, and all across the long red dirt roads, verdant mountains and open blue skies of Africa. The leaders of African countries have made education more of a priority, even for girls. Now, girls can be role models. Girls like me, a cattle herder who married young, and by age 18 had three children and no high school diploma.\n\nQuestion: What is the current state of education?", "answer": ""}

The more men could read and write, the better their chances of being employed and able to provide for their family. As a result, families wanted to educate their sons, who became village role models. Without an education, how could girls compete? How could they become role models, too? That was more than 40 years ago. Today, change is happening in my beloved Matau, and all across the long red dirt roads, verdant mountains and open blue skies of Africa. The leaders of African countries have made education more of a priority, even for girls. Now, girls can be role models. Girls like me, a cattle herder who married young, and by age 18 had three children and no high school diploma.\n\nQuestion: Do girls get an education now?", "answer": ""}
{"question": "(CNN) -- Eight-year-old Tineyi takes my hand and leads me into her mud-thatched hut in my home village of Matau in rural Zimbabwe.

{"question": "John wanted to have a birthday party for his son, Mike. John and his wife Sara knew that their son loved clowns, as did their daughter Jane. So they looked up a place to have a clown come to his birthday party. When the clown arrived, ten of Mikes friends showed up to watch the show. His parents had sent out 12 invites, thinking 6 or 8 kids would come. The clown started the show by squirting some water from a flower into John's face. This caused John's face to turn red. After the show, when everyone had left, it was up to John and Sara to clean up after the party. There was food everywhere; they had had salad and there was lettuce on the ground. Later that evening it was dinnertime and the family had to choose what to eat. The choices were order a pizza, make hamburgers, go get fried chicken or make noodles. Since it was Mike's birthday they let him choose. He really wanted pizza so they called up Pizza Palace to place their order. When the pizza arrived it did not come in a square box like most pizzas. Instead it was in a round box that no one had ever seen. John gave everybody a slice and then placed Mike in his lap to eat dinner.\n\nQuestion: What did Mike do later in the day after his party?", "answer": ""}

{"question": "The New York City Council yesterday offered a radically different set of priorities for the handling of the city's legal work in its response to Mayor Bloomberg's plan to close a projected $4.8 billion budget deficit. The City Council plan would increase by nearly 50 percent - to $80.4 million - the amount of funding Mayor Bloomberg proposed for the Legal Aid Society by sharply curtailing compensation for court-appointed lawyers under the 18-B program. The City Council plan would also reduce to 2 percent the Bloomberg plan's 7 percent cut for District Attorney's Offices citywide. The City Council's proposal for the 650-lawyer Corporation Counsel's Office would slash its budget by 10 percent - or $10.2 million - to $92 million. In contrast, Mayor Bloomberg's budget plan called for a modest 3.8 percent in the Corporation Counsel's budget, leaving the office relatively untouched in comparison to most other mayoral agencies. Council aides said yesterday that they did not have a head count for the cuts at the Law Department, but that the City Council plan is tilted towards the elimination of legal positions, which at 10 percent would require the layoff of more than 65 lawyers. At the same time, the City Council plan envisages dramatic cuts in the legal departments of many city agencies with a view to transferring the work to the Law Department. The plan also calls for the elimination of the Mayor's Office of Contracts, which would save $1.8 million, and the transfer of the legal work done by that agency to the Corporation Counsel's Office. Council aides did not have a total for the savings that would be realized in city agency legal departments through its plan. But, they said, the proposal would save $10 million by eliminating more than 300 lawyers at the Administration for Children's Services, many of whom prosecute neglect and abuse cases in Family Court. Jack Deacy, a spokesman for Administration for Children's Services, was unavailable for comment. Council aides also identified steep cuts in the legal departments of other agencies: all 40 lawyers at the Department of Correction for a savings of $2 million; 21 of 28 lawyers at the Department of Sanitation, saving $945,000; and seven of 10 lawyers at the Department of Buildings, $451,000 in savings. Asked how the Corporation Counsel's Office could take on the expanded work while its own legal staff was being cut, Thomas L.

{"question": "The New York City Council yesterday offered a radically different set of priorities for the handling of the city's legal work in its response to Mayor Bloomberg's plan to close a projected $4.8 billion budget deficit. The City Council plan would increase by nearly 50 percent - to $80.4 million - the amount of funding Mayor Bloomberg proposed for the Legal Aid Society by sharply curtailing compensation for court-appointed lawyers under the 18-B program. The City Council plan would also reduce to 2 percent the Bloomberg plan's 7 percent cut for District Attorney's Offices citywide. The City Council's proposal for the 650-lawyer Corporation Counsel's Office would slash its budget by 10 percent - or $10.2 million - to $92 million. In contrast, Mayor Bloomberg's budget plan called for a modest 3.8 percent in the Corporation Counsel's budget, leaving the office relatively untouched in comparison to most other mayoral agencies. Council aides said yesterday that they did not have a head count for the cuts at the Law Department, but that the City Council plan is tilted towards the elimination of legal positions, which at 10 percent would require the layoff of more than 65 lawyers. At the same time, the City Council plan envisages dramatic cuts in the legal departments of many city agencies with a view to transferring the work to the Law Department. The plan also calls for the elimination of the Mayor's Office of Contracts, which would save $1.8 million, and the transfer of the legal work done by that agency to the Corporation Counsel's Office. Council aides did not have a total for the savings that would be realized in city agency legal departments through its plan. But, they said, the proposal would save $10 million by eliminating more than 300 lawyers at the Administration for Children's Services, many of whom prosecute neglect and abuse cases in Family Court. Jack Deacy, a spokesman for Administration for Children's Services, was unavailable for comment. Council aides also identified steep cuts in the legal departments of other agencies: all 40 lawyers at the Department of Correction for a savings of $2 million; 21 of 28 lawyers at the Department of Sanitation, saving $945,000; and seven of 10 lawyers at the Department of Buildings, $451,000 in savings.

{"question": "Aunt Jane was equally surprised and gratified.  The return of the check for a hundred dollars was very pleasant.  She had drawn a similar check for each of her three nieces, believing that it would be necessary for her to meet their expenses, and she had considered the expenditure in the nature of a business transaction.  But Patricia had flung one check in her face, practically, and now Louise had voluntarily returned another, because she did not need the money.  Really, Jane Merrick was accomplishing her purpose for less money than she had expected, and she had hoarded her wealth for so many years that she disliked to spend any of it foolishly.  Louise had read her nature correctly.  It had been a little hard to return so large a check, but the girl's policy was not to appear before Aunt Jane as a poor relation, but rather as a young lady fitted by social education and position to become a gracious mistress of Elmhurst.

They may have started as part of a mountain and then broken up. You may have small decorative rocks around your home. These too came from even larger rock. Therefore, they have been through the process of weathering. Even soil has been broken down from larger and larger rocks. It takes a long time for a rock or mountain to weather. Have you ever traveled to a colder part of the world? If so, you may have noticed all the holes in the roads. These holes appear in the spring after a cold winter. This breaking apart of the roadway is a form of weathering. Its causes are the same as what happens to large mountains.

{"question": "The law was written at a time when public housing complexes were under assault by drug-dealing gangs and politicians were pressured to take action. Families can be removed for drug use by one member, whether the drug activity is in the home or somewhere else. Under the Department of Housing and Urban Development' enforcement program, tenants may not avoid eviction simply by claiming ignorance of the crime or an inability to stop it. Carlos Sanchez, executive director of the Grand Rapids Housing Commission, believes the law can be effective if it's applied with discretion. The commission administers about 3,500 public housing units in the Grand Rapids area, including Creston Plaza. \"I think if it's done with caution, it's a tool that we desperately needed in our developments,\" Sanchez said. Sanchez said Grand Rapids doesn't have the large-scale drug problems larger cities do -- and he wants to keep it that way. \"We've done the best we can to keep it from being so drug-infested it becomes a war zone. Once the development is taken over, it's very difficult to take them back.\" Sanchez said the commission relies on police reports in deciding evictions, which he estimated at one or two a year. Among those cases, according to Leslie Curry, litigation director of Western Michigan Legal Services, was that of a mother evicted from public housing about a year ago with several young children. She was removed because her 17-year-old son was arrested selling drugs outside the apartment, Curry said. That left her with the hardship of seeking a place she could afford for herself and her children, without the certainty she afford the rent. \"She didn't know about it,\" Curry said of the drug deal. \"In Grand Rapids, subsidized housing is critical to people's ability to maintain basic security in their lives.\"\n\nQuestion: Did the mother of the 17 year old know that he was selling drugs before she was evicted?", "answer": ""}

{"question": "States like Minnesota and New Jersey spend three times more than California to meet the poor's legal needs, Connecticut and Massachusetts spend more than twice as much, and countries like England, Canada, Australia, Scotland and New Zealand spend anywhere from two to 14 times more proportionately than California, despite the fact that California has the world's sixth largest economy. The report says the state would need to triple its combined public and private investment in legal services to adequately meet the legal needs of low-income Californians. The 1996 welfare reform legisla tion, in particular, brought dramatic changes to the lives of those living in poverty, for while fewer people now receive welfare benefits, those who left welfare to work are still poor. And the legal issues they face \"have become more numerous and complex,\" the report said. \"Parents who found only low-paying jobs without health benefits did not improve the well-being of their children. Women who entered the workforce in low-skilled positions with no opportunity to acquire marketable skills lack realistic long-term options. Obstacles to employment such as lack of child care and transportation, domestic violence and job discrimination raise a host of new legal issues.\" Those issues revolve around an extensive universe of problems, including housing, education, domestic violence, immigration, employment, grandparent guardianships, bankruptcy and consumer debt, veterans' issues, elder abuse and home equity fraud, the report said. To meet all those needs, there is only one legal aid lawyer for every 10,000 poor Californians. Despite this bleak picture, the state's civil justice community has taken significant steps to close the gap between need and services in the past five years: The legislature and the governor established the Equal Access Fund, which has provided $10 million annually since 1999 for more than 100 local legal services programs. Access to the courts has been enhanced through a variety of self-help options, including online assistance in every county, a system of family law facilitators, increased funding for alternative dispute resolution and simplified forms and procedures. The Judicial Council is addressing language barriers by increasing the availability of qualified interpreters and translating forms and instructions into Spanish, Vietnam-ese, Korean and Chinese. Legal services programs have been strengthened by offering a wide range of services, including self-help clinics and hotlines and working relationships with social services agencies to meet all of a client's needs. Still, when more than 70 percent of the poor's legal needs are not being met, much remains to be done, the report points out. It recommends adding to the access fund, increasing both the number of pro bono hours and financial contributions from attorneys, improved assistance for unrepresented litigants and access to an attorney for those who require one, and development of a statewide plan to distribute legal services more evenly throughout the state to insure that the rural population also is served. \"I know my fe llow judges want to do justice and not inflict injustice,\" observed Justice Earl Johnson of the California Court of Appeal, who chaired the committee that researched and wrote the report. \"More than anyone, they know it can be nearly impossible to do the former and avoid the latter in a one-sided contest where only one litigant has a lawyer.\" \"Our whole society is harmed when access and fairness are denied,\" said Londen.\n\nQuestion: What are some of the problems involved in obstacles to employment such as lack of child care and transportation, domestic violence, and job discrimination?", "answer": ""}

The Judicial Council is addressing language barriers by increasing the availability of qualified interpreters and translating forms and instructions into Spanish, Vietnam-ese, Korean and Chinese. Legal services programs have been strengthened by offering a wide range of services, including self-help clinics and hotlines and working relationships with social services agencies to meet all of a client's needs. Still, when more than 70 percent of the poor's legal needs are not being met, much remains to be done, the report points out. It recommends adding to the access fund, increasing both the number of pro bono hours and financial contributions from attorneys, improved assistance for unrepresented litigants and access to an attorney for those who require one, and development of a statewide plan to distribute legal services more evenly throughout the state to insure that the rural population also is served. \"I know my fe llow judges want to do justice and not inflict injustice,\" observed Justice Earl Johnson of the California Court of Appeal, who chaired the committee that researched and wrote the report. \"More than anyone, they know it can be nearly impossible to do the former and avoid the latter in a one-sided contest where only one litigant has a lawyer.\" \"Our whole society is harmed when access and fairness are denied,\" said Londen.\n\nQuestion: What is nearly impossible to do when only one litigant has a lawyer?", "answer": ""}

{"question": "Fact: Some places are timeless. Days passed, weeks passed, but I couldn't tell if it had been months or years since I was rescued. All there was, all I remembered, was a blur.

Now and then, a new face mingled in the crowd. Other faces washed out, fading into the backdrop of carpets and fake glass chandeliers and the muted hum of the engines.

{"question": "A state foundation is giving West Texas Legal Services and the Fort Worth chapter of the NAACP more than $1 million to help provide civil legal services to the poor. The Texas Equal Access to Justice Foundation announced that the Fort Worth-based nonprofit groups will receive grants from funds it controls, including the Interest on Lawyers' Trust Accounts, or IOLTA, program. West Texas Legal Services, which works with clients in 106 counties including Tarrant, Lubbock, Midland and Potter, will get about $1.03 million. The legal aid group cleared about 8,300 cases last year. \"It is going to help us out tremendously with our program,\" said Kathy Duncan at West Texas Legal Services. \"If it wasn't for the grant, we couldn't continue to do the work we are doing.\" West Texas handles such cases as divorces, protective orders in domestic violence cases and land-lord-tenant disputes. It has a staff of about 100 employees, including attorneys and support staff, in 10 branch offices. The NAACP's Fort Worth Justice Project will get $49,000. Officials from the group's legal assistance program were not available to comment. Created by the Texas Supreme Court, the Equal Access foundation has distributed about $8 million statewide.

{"question": "(CNN) -- The first Roman Catholic priest in the United States imprisoned for covering up the crimes of offending priests was ordered to be released Thursday after an appeals court reversed his conviction. Monsignor William Lynn has been in prison since he was convicted in July 2012. He was convicted of one count of child endangerment and sentenced to three to six years. Attorney Thomas Bergstrom said Lynn could be released as soon as Friday, depending on paperwork. Philadelphia District Attorney Seth Williams said his office likely will appeal the ruling. \"I am disappointed and strongly disagree with the court's decision,\" he said. Lynn's conviction was for not removing a defrocked priest, Edward Avery, from active ministry in the 1990s after learning Avery had molested a teen. According to philly.com, Lynn's attorneys convinced the three-judge Superior Court panel that the laws at the time only applied to people who directly supervised children. The founder of Opus Bono Sacerdotii, a Detroit organization that provides assistance to accused priests, told philly.com the ruling will make prosecutors \"reflect on who is really accountable for the damage that may have been done to victims of sexual abuse.\" Marci Hamilton, a lawyer for alleged victims suing Lynn and the Philadelphia archdiocese, called the decision a \"very technical reading of the law,\" the website reported.

Lynn's conviction was for not removing a defrocked priest, Edward Avery, from active ministry in the 1990s after learning Avery had molested a teen. According to philly.com, Lynn's attorneys convinced the three-judge Superior Court panel that the laws at the time only applied to people who directly supervised children. The founder of Opus Bono Sacerdotii, a Detroit organization that provides assistance to accused priests, told philly.com the ruling will make prosecutors \"reflect on who is really accountable for the damage that may have been done to victims of sexual abuse.\" Marci Hamilton, a lawyer for alleged victims suing Lynn and the Philadelphia archdiocese, called the decision a \"very technical reading of the law,\" the website reported. Lynn, now 62, made no statement Thursday, but after he was convicted 18 months ago he said: \"I've tried to serve God as best I could. My best was not good enough.\"\n\nQuestion: Who was disappointed with the court's decision and how were Lynn's lawyers able to convince the three-judge Superior Court panel to overturn the conviction?", "answer": ""}
{"question": "Lighting a cigarette, he started for the lake and Grace returned thoughtfully to the house.  Mortimer hated Cartwright and Grace admitted he had some grounds.

{"question": "Olivia had long suspected Ellis of feeling a more than friendly interest in Clara. Herself partial to Tom, she had more than once thought it hardly fair to Delamere, or even to Clara, who was young and impressionable, to have another young man constantly about the house. True, there had seemed to be no great danger, for Ellis had neither the family nor the means to make him a suitable match for the major's sister; nor had Clara made any secret of her dislike for Ellis, or of her resentment for his supposed depreciation of Delamere. Mrs. Carteret was inclined to a more just and reasonable view of Ellis's conduct in this matter, but nevertheless did not deem it wise to undeceive Clara. Dislike was a stout barrier, which remorse might have broken down. The major, absorbed in schemes of empire and dreams of his child's future, had not become cognizant of the affair. His wife, out of friendship for Tom, had refrained from mentioning it; while the major, with a delicate regard for Clara's feelings, had said nothing at home in regard to his interview with her lover.\n\nQuestion: Why was Ellis a poor match for Clara?", "answer": ""}

{"question": "The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) within the Department of Transportation had been vested by Congress with the sometimes conflicting mandate of regulating the safety and security of U.S. civil aviation while also promoting the civil aviation industry. The FAA had a security mission to protect the users of commercial air transportation against terrorism and other criminal acts. In the years before 9/11, the FAA perceived sabotage as a greater threat to aviation than hijacking. First, no domestic hijacking had occurred in a decade. Second, the commercial aviation system was perceived as more vulnerable to explosives than to weapons such as firearms. Finally, explosives were perceived as deadlier than hijacking and therefore of greater consequence. In 1996, a presidential commission on aviation safety and security chaired by Vice President Al Gore reinforced the prevailing concern about sabotage and explosives on aircraft. The Gore Commission also flagged, as a new danger, the possibility of attack by surface-to-air missiles. Its 1997 final report did not discuss the possibility of suicide hijackings. The FAA set and enforced aviation security rules, which airlines and airports were required to implement. The rules were supposed to produce a \"layered\" system of defense. This meant that the failure of any one layer of security would not be fatal, because additional layers would provide backup security. But each layer relevant to hijackings-intelligence, passenger prescreening, checkpoint screening, and onboard security-was seriously flawed prior to 9/11. Taken together, they did not stop any of the 9/11 hijackers from getting on board four different aircraft at three different airports. The FAA's policy was to use intelligence to identify both specific plots and general threats to civil aviation security, so that the agency could develop and deploy appropriate countermeasures. The FAA's 40-person intelligence unit was supposed to receive a broad range of intelligence data from the FBI, CIA, and other agencies so that it could make assessments about the threat to aviation. But the large volume of data contained little pertaining to the presence and activities of terrorists in the United States. For example, information on the FBI's effort in 1998 to assess the potential use of flight training by terrorists and the Phoenix electronic communication of 2001 warning of radical Middle Easterners attending flight school were not passed to FAA headquarters.\n\nQuestion: What were the rules set out by the FAA following the release of the Final Gore Commission report designed to improve?", "answer": ""}

In 1996, a presidential commission on aviation safety and security chaired by Vice President Al Gore reinforced the prevailing concern about sabotage and explosives on aircraft. The Gore Commission also flagged, as a new danger, the possibility of attack by surface-to-air missiles. Its 1997 final report did not discuss the possibility of suicide hijackings. The FAA set and enforced aviation security rules, which airlines and airports were required to implement. The rules were supposed to produce a \"layered\" system of defense. This meant that the failure of any one layer of security would not be fatal, because additional layers would provide backup security. But each layer relevant to hijackings-intelligence, passenger prescreening, checkpoint screening, and onboard security-was seriously flawed prior to 9/11. Taken together, they did not stop any of the 9/11 hijackers from getting on board four different aircraft at three different airports. The FAA's policy was to use intelligence to identify both specific plots and general threats to civil aviation security, so that the agency could develop and deploy appropriate countermeasures. The FAA's 40-person intelligence unit was supposed to receive a broad range of intelligence data from the FBI, CIA, and other agencies so that it could make assessments about the threat to aviation. But the large volume of data contained little pertaining to the presence and activities of terrorists in the United States.

The ship , originally sent to collect data on Saturn , has its course diverted to investigate the mysterious star Gorath , reported as being 6000 times the size of the Earth . It is feared that the star 's path could come dangerously close to Earth . The JX-1 reaches locates Gorath and it 's much smaller than earth but with 6000 times the gravity . The JX-1 radio 's back any data about the star but gets sucked into the star 's gravitational field which drags the ship into Gorath , incinerating it . Japan and the rest of the world are stunned by the discovery and , after some reluctance , send up the JX-2 Ootori spaceship for a voyage to investigate Gorath . The United Nations band together to discover a solution to the problem , and decide that their only solutions are to either destroy Gorath or move the planet out of the way . Back on Earth , the UN decides on the plan to move the Earth out of the way of Gorath , the South Pole Operation . The plan is to have atomic energy channeled through huge atomic furnaces 500 meters below the surface , then fed though enormous pipes called thrusters which will all fire in unison . But for this to work they will need an area 600 kilometers producing an atomic force equal to that of 6,600,000,000 megatons to move the Earth 400,000 kilometers way from Gorath .

{"question": "Have you ever felt a shock? Maybe you had just walked across the carpet and touched something metal? How is this similar to lightning? Believe it or not, they are very similar. They are both discharges of static electricity. Lightning is static electricity on a grand scale. Lightning discharges a lot of electric charge. It happens all at once. Unfortunately, this large discharge is not useful. It is so large and so fast, it cannot be controlled. You cant plug a toaster into a lightning bolt! For most devices, a much smaller amount of electric charge is needed. It must also be steady. It cant come all in one big jolt. Thats why we cant run our homes off of lightning. Our homes need to have a steady and continuous supply of electric current.\n\nQuestion: Is the shock similar to lightning?", "answer": ""}

{"question": "Since the beginning of the American Civil War, Hamilton has been depicted on more denominations of US currency than anyone else. He has appeared on the $2, $5, $10, $20, $50, and $1,000. His likeness also began to appear on US postage in 1870. His portrait has continued to appear on US postage and currency, and most notably appears on the modern $10 bill, though it was announced on 18 June 2015 that his portrait would be replaced by that of a woman, to reflect the changing nature of American democracy and society. Hamilton also appears on the $500 Series EE Savings Bond. The source of the face on the $10 bill is John Trumbull's 1805 portrait of Hamilton, in the portrait collection of New York City Hall. The first postage stamp to honor Hamilton was issued by the U.S. Post Office in 1870. The portrayals on the 1870 and 1888 issues are from the same engraved die, which was modeled after a bust of Hamilton by Italian sculptor Giuseppe Ceracchi The Hamilton 1870 issue was the first US Postage stamp to honor a Secretary of the Treasury. The three-cent red commemorative issue, which was released on the 200th anniversary of Hamilton's birth in 1957, includes a rendition of the Federal Hall building, located in New York City.

{"question": "Italy has only existed as a nation since 1871. Before then, despite the peninsula's obvious geographical unity bounded by the Alps and the Mediterranean, its story is a fragmented tale of independent-minded cities, regions, and islands — and the outside powers who coveted them. We have abundant evidence of the ancient Etruscan, Greek, and Roman communities in Italy, but know very little of the country's earlier, prehistoric settlers. Vestiges of dwellings survive — cabins on stilts in the frequently flooded Po valley, larger clay houses on the western marshlands of Tuscany, and Sardinia's still visible domed dry-stone nuraghi. But the inhabitants? Perhaps North Africans and eastern Europeans peopled the Ligurian coast, while the Adriatic and south may have been settled by people from the Balkans and Asia Minor. Nobody knows much about the early Etruscans. Some historians believe that they were the first native Italians; others believe they arrived from Asia Minor. During the millennium before the Christian era, their civilization reached north beyond Tuscany to the Po valley and south toward Naples. At a time when early Roman and other Latin tribes were still primitive, Etruscan society — itself savage in many respects — was also aristocratic and highly sophisticated. Solid gold workmanship and other metal ornaments and tools showed a Greek influence, but the Etruscans' vaulted architecture, town planning, and irrigation systems were indigenous. Arriving in the eighth century b.c. , the Greeks set up city-states in Sicily, dominated by Syracuse, as well as other settlements on the Italian mainland, such as Naples, Paestum, and Taranto. Together they formed Magna Graecia, whose zenith was reached during the 6th and 5th centuries b.c. After defeats by Greeks in the south, Latins in the center, and Gallic invaders in the north, the Etruscan empire faded in the fourth century b.c.

Bin Laden was prepared to pick up where he had left off in Sudan. He was ready to strike at \"The head of the snake.\" Al Qaeda's role in organizing terrorist operations had also changed. Before the move to Afghanistan, it had concentrated on providing funds, training, and weapons for actions carried out by members of Ailied groups.

The Embassy Bombings As early as December 1993, a team of al Qaeda operatives had begun casing targets in Nairobi for future attacks. It was led by Ali Mohamed, a former Egyptian army officer who had moved to the United States in the mid-1980s, enlisted in the U.S. Army, and became an instructor at Fort Bragg. He had provided guidance and training to extremists at the Farouq mosque in Brooklyn, including some who were subsequently convicted in the February 1993 attack on the World Trade Center. The casing team also included a computer expert whose write-ups were reviewed by al Qaeda leaders. The team set up a makeshift laboratory for developing their surveillance photographs in an apartment in Nairobi where the various al Qaeda operatives and leaders based in or traveling to the Kenya cell sometimes met. Banshiri, al Qaeda's military committee chief, continued to be the operational commander of the cell; but because he was constantly on the move,  Bin Laden had dispatched another operative, Khaled al Fawwaz, to serve as the on-site manager. The technical surveillance and communications equipment employed for these casing missions included state-of-the-art video cameras obtained from China and from dealers in Germany. The casing team also reconnoitered targets in Djibouti. As early as January 1994,  Bin Laden received the surveillance reports, complete with diagrams prepared by the team's computer specialist. He, his top military committee members-Banshiri and his deputy, Abu Hafs al Masri (also known as Mohammed Atef)-and a number of other al Qaeda leaders reviewed the reports. Agreeing that the U.S. embassy in Nairobi was an easy target because a car bomb could be parked close by, they began to form a plan.

{"question": "Hannah and her friend Mary were bored. They sat around the house and tried to think about what to do. They petted the cat. They drew pictures in Hannah's notebook. They snuck into Hannah's mother's closet to try on her shoes, but Hannah's mother caught them. She said, \"You girls need something to do. Let's take a walk to the park!\" Hannah and Mary looked at each other, and then jumped up and down happily. \"The park sounds great!\" said Hannah. \"Let's go!\" cried Mary. So Hannah's mother packed up a snack of apples and cookies, and they all set off to walk to the park. They walked down the sidewalk, looking at all the interesting things along the way. Mary spotted a squirrel. Hannah saw a yellow bird. Hannah's mother pointed out the pretty yellow flowers growing in front of Mr. Smith's house. When they got to the park, Hannah's mother spread out a picnic blanket and the snack. Hannah and Mary ran around chasing butterflies for a little time, and then sat down to eat their snacks. When they finished, Hannah's mother put the leftovers in a trash can.

{"question": "(CNN) -- In November 2009, Norwegian freelance journalist Paul Refsdal is riding in a pick-up truck on a dusty track of Afghan road. The Taliban have kidnapped him. If the truck turns right, he knows he's being sold to another militant group. A left turn means his kidnappers have decided to let him go. His journey started when Refsdal, who wanted to document the daily lives of the Taliban, accepted the invitation of a Taliban commander to film him and his fighters. Refsdal later accompanied another Taliban commander, Omar, to his hideout on a second embed. As part of CNN's \"Taliban\" documentary, Refsdal talked with CNN's Anderson Cooper about going from invited guest to kidnap victim -- a harrowing experience that began the way it later ended, with Refsdal in a truck. Here is an edited excerpt: REFSDAL: We rent a pickup truck and we drive into this valley that doesn't really have a road. I'm told it is not possible to drive anymore. We will have to walk for several hours up the hillside to one village, and we have to sneak a little bit. Omar is very particular about I should cover my face. I assume this is because they don't want informers to see that there's a foreigner coming. And we sleep in a house, and everything seems OK. Then, the next day we are asked to go to another house, just 100 meters down the hillside. We have to wait there, because they're going to have a meeting. After a couple hours, one of the fighters comes and says he's from al Qaeda. And he says that he has information that I was spying for the coalition, so both my translator and I will be executed tonight. And he goes on, saying that we're going to be killed with a knife. ... He explains how much he hates foreigners and he wants to eat the flesh of foreigners.\n\nQuestion: What is the terrorist group affiliation of the man who accused Refsdal of spying?", "answer": ""}

{"question": "(CNN) -- The Australian government has admitted it has 153 people, including children, in custody at sea while it fights a High Court challenge to any plans to send them back to Sri Lanka. Until Tuesday's court hearing in Melbourne, the government had refused to confirm or deny it was holding the suspected asylum seekers, in line with its policy of not commenting on operational matters under \"Operation Sovereign Borders.\" All those on board are thought to be Tamils who left the Indian port of Pondicherry on a 72-foot boat in mid-June. They include three-year-old Febrina, whose image was released by a worried relative who hasn't heard from his family for more than a week. \"I am desperate to know where my family is. I can't function at all not knowing. I know all of them would be in very big trouble if sent back to Sri Lanka,\" he said, via an interpreter to the Tamil Refugee Council in Australia, before Tuesday's hearing. The government launched Operation Sovereign Borders last September, a military-led campaign to \"stop the boats,\" referring to a steady stream of vessels crammed with asylum seekers trying to make it to Australian waters. Critics, including human rights campaigners, have slammed the policy, which advocates \"turn-backs\" and the offshore processing of asylum claims, as cruel and unnecessary. 'Culture of secrecy' On Tuesday, they also took aim at the \"culture of secrecy,\" which created days of uncertainty for family members whose relatives were presumably lost at sea, and resulted in a vacuum of official information to back up claims that a boat had gone missing. \"It took getting a case to the High Court before the government would admit that they did have those people in custody and that they were on the high seas, that's not good enough,\" said Ian Rintoul, from the Refugee Action Coalition. David Manne, Executive Director of the Refugee and Immigration Legal Center (RILC), said the government's silence raised \"profound concerns\" about whether their rights and Australia's obligations under international law were being breached.\n\nQuestion: In this paragraph, \"offshore\" can be taken to mean where?", "answer": ""}

{"question": "Prehistory and Early Chronicles: As evidenced by bones, weapons, and pottery most recently uncovered by archeologists, the Asian equivalent of Neanderthal Man crossed a now-submerged land bridge from eastern Siberia to what is now Sakhalin Island and northern Japan some 100,000 years ago. These migrants, who later settled throughout the Japanese archipelago, were the ancestors of the present-day Ainu, whose Caucasoid facial and body hair distinguished them from subsequent immigrants from China, Manchuria, Korea, and perhaps the Malay Peninsula. It was the growth and military assertion of the newcomers that drove the \"hairy people\" (as they were labeled) back north to their present concentration in Hokkaido. The oldest Stone Age settlements to be discovered (10,000 b.c. ) are known as Jomon (\"cord pattern\"), after the style of their handmade pottery, which was among the earliest to be found anywhere in the world and of rich and imaginative design. Their inhabitants dwelled in sunken pits and lived from hunting, fishing, and the gathering of roots and nuts. It wasn't until the third century b.c. that techniques of rice cultivation (and wheel-made pottery) arrived from Korea, along with irrigation methods that are still in use today. The scarcity of flatlands suitable for cultivation made it possible for a small aristocratic elite to gain quick control of the food resources. This set the pattern of hierarchic rule that was to prevail right up to the last half of the 19th century (some would claim, in economic terms at least, that it still persists today). Although there are no reliable accounts of this period, third-century Chinese documents speak of a Japanese priestess-queen, Himiko, ruling over a land of law-abiding people who enjoyed alcohol and were divided into classes distinguished by tattoo marks. Five centuries later, Japan's own Kojiki and Nihon-shoki chronicles describe the creation of the imperial dynasty in the year 660 b.c. : the first emperor, Jimmu (\"Divine Warrior\") — great grandson of the Sun Goddess's grandson — embarked on an expedition of conquest from Kyushu along the Inland Sea coast to the Yamato plain of the Kinki region (near modern-day Nara). Plausible chronicling, laced with a dose of mythology, begins with the arrival of Korean scribes at the Japanese court around a.d. 400, at a time when Japan also had a military foothold in southern Korea. The state of Yamato, as early Japan was known, was organized into uji, or clusters of clans, together with subordinate guilds of farmers, fishermen, hunters, weavers, and potters, all subject to the dominant uji of the imperial family.\n\nQuestion: What are the oldest Stone Age settlements known as?", "answer": ""}

{"question": "At age 16, Alexander's education under Aristotle ended. Philip waged war against Byzantion, leaving Alexander in charge as regent and heir apparent. During Philip's absence, the Thracian Maedi revolted against Macedonia. Alexander responded quickly, driving them from their territory. He colonized it with Greeks, and founded a city named Alexandropolis. Upon Philip's return, he dispatched Alexander with a small force to subdue revolts in southern Thrace. Campaigning against the Greek city of Perinthus, Alexander is reported to have saved his father's life. Meanwhile, the city of Amphissa began to work lands that were sacred to Apollo near Delphi, a sacrilege that gave Philip the opportunity to further intervene in Greek affairs. Still occupied in Thrace, he ordered Alexander to muster an army for a campaign in Greece. Concerned that other Greek states might intervene, Alexander made it look as though he was preparing to attack Illyria instead. During this turmoil, the Illyrians invaded Macedonia, only to be repelled by Alexander. Philip and his army joined his son in 338 BC, and they marched south through Thermopylae, taking it after stubborn resistance from its Theban garrison. They went on to occupy the city of Elatea, only a few days' march from both Athens and Thebes. The Athenians, led by Demosthenes, voted to seek alliance with Thebes against Macedonia. Both Athens and Philip sent embassies to win Thebes' favor, but Athens won the contest. Philip marched on Amphissa (ostensibly acting on the request of the Amphictyonic League), capturing the mercenaries sent there by Demosthenes and accepting the city's surrender. Philip then returned to Elatea, sending a final offer of peace to Athens and Thebes, who both rejected it.\n\nQuestion: Why was Alexander the one to respond when Thracian Maedi revolted against Macedonia?", "answer": ""}

{"question": "Shelley was, in the main, not only an exquisite but a trustworthy critic; and no man was more absolutely above being influenced by the fanfaronade of rank or the din of popularity.  These criticisms are therefore not to be lightly set aside, nor are they unintelligible.  Perhaps those admirers of the clearer and more consistent nature, who exalt him to the rank of a greater poet, are misled by the amiable love of one of the purest characters in the history of our literature.

{"question": "The history of Hawaii reads like the story of a mythical kingdom. The first wave of Polynesian settlers crossed the equator and arrived from the Marquesas in the South Pacific perhaps as early as a.d. These immigrant voyages were breathtaking and treacherous, requiring the crossing of 2,500 miles (4,000 km) of open seas aboard dugout catamarans and outrigger canoes. Their destination was even more resplendent with forests than the paradise we see today, but hoary bats and monk seals were the only mammals in residence. The first Polynesian settlers brought much of what they needed, however, from pigs and chickens to bananas and taro, the root crop that would sustain them. Paddies of taro are to this day a signature crop in rural Hawaii. A second wave of Polynesian immigrants from Tahiti arrived centuries later. By a.d. 1300 they had erased the vestiges of a Marquesan outpost and developed a Hawaiian society of their own. Rival chiefs ruled each island; fish farms and temples were laid out; and tribal and inter-island warfare was common. The chiefs governed their feudal domains by force, ritual, and taboo. The system of taboo (kapu) gave society its laws and the people a complex moral code. To fend off natural and cosmic cata­stro­phes, the rituals of human sacrifice came into play, intended to placate the more violent of the local gods, such as those of the volcanoes and typhoons. While such island societies might seem less than Edenic, the early Hawaiians led a pleasurable life, singing their own histories to the beat of gourds, riding the waves on long wooden surfboards, and developing an elaborate, graceful form of story-dance, the hula.\n\nQuestion: What did they feel they had to defend themselves against?", "answer": ""}

{"question": "Not all waves are caused by winds. A shock to the ocean can also send waves through water. A tsunami is a wave, or set of waves, that is usually caused by an earthquake. As we have seen in recent years, the waves can be enormous and extremely destructive. Tsunamis can travel at speeds of 800 kilometers per hour (500 miles per hour). Usually tsunami waves travel through the ocean unnoticed. Tsunami waves have very small wave heights. In contrast, they have very long wavelengths. If you were at sea, you would not notice it pass under your ship. But when they reach the shore they become enormous. Tsunami waves can flood entire regions. They destroy property and cause many deaths.\n\nQuestion: Why are tsunami waves so dangerous near shore?", "answer": ""}

{"question": "Clouds are classified on the basis of where and how they form. Three main types of clouds are cirrus, stratus, and cumulus. Figure 2.25 shows these and other types of clouds. Cirrus clouds form high in the troposphere. Because it is so cold they are made of ice crystals. They are thin and wispy. Cirrus clouds dont usually produce precipitation, but they may be a sign that wet weather is coming. Stratus clouds occur low in the troposphere. They form in layers that spread horizontally and may cover the entire sky like a thick blanket. Stratus clouds that produce precipitation are called nimbostratus. The prefix nimbo- means rain. Cumulus clouds are white and puffy. Convection currents make them grow upward and they may grow very tall.

{"question": "By early 1999, al Qaeda was already a potent adversary of the United States.  Bin Laden and his chief of operations, Abu Hafs al Masri, also known as Mohammed Atef, occupied undisputed leadership positions atop al Qaeda's organizational structure. Within this structure, al Qaeda's worldwide terrorist operations relied heavily on the ideas and work of enterprising and strongwilled field commanders who enjoyed considerable autonomy. To understand how the organization actually worked and to introduce the origins of the 9/11 plot, we briefly examine three of these subordinate commanders: Khalid Sheikh Mohammed (KSM), Riduan Isamuddin (better known as Hambali), and Abd al Rahim al Nashiri. We will devote the most attention to Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the chief manager of the \"planes operation.\" Khalid Sheikh Mohammed No one exemplifies the model of the terrorist entrepreneur more clearly than Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the principal architect of the 9/11 attacks. KSM followed a rather tortuous path to his eventual membership in al Qaeda. Highly educated and equally comfortable in a government office or a terrorist safehouse, KSM applied his imagination, technical aptitude, and managerial skills to hatching and planning an extraordinary array of terrorist schemes. These ideas included conventional car bombing, political assassination, aircraft bombing, hijacking, reservoir poisoning, and, ultimately, the use of aircraft as missiles guided by suicide operatives. Like his nephew Ramzi Yousef (three years KSM's junior), KSM grew up in Kuwait but traces his ethnic lineage to the Baluchistan region straddling Iran and Pakistan. Raised in a religious family, KSM claims to have joined the Muslim Brotherhood at age 16 and to have become enamored of violent jihad at youth camps in the desert. In 1983, following his graduation from secondary school, KSM left Kuwait to enroll at Chowan College, a small Baptist school in Murfreesboro, North Carolina. After a semester at Chowan, KSM transferred to North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University in Greensboro, which he attended with Yousef 's brother, another future al Qaeda member. KSM earned a degree in mechanical engineering in December 1986. Although he apparently did not attract attention for extreme Islamist beliefs or activities while in the United States, KSM plunged into the anti-Soviet Afghan jihad soon after graduating from college. Visiting Pakistan for the first time in early 1987, he traveled to Peshawar, where his brother Zahid introduced him to the famous Afghan mujahid Abdul Rasul Sayyaf, head of the Hizbul- Ittihad El-Islami (Islamic Union Party). Sayyaf became KSM's mentor and provided KSM with military training at Sayyaf 's Sada camp. KSM claims he then fought the Soviets and remained at the front for three months before being summoned to perform administrative duties for Abdullah Azzam.\n\nQuestion: What were parts of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed's educational journey?", "answer": ""}

{"question": "Into the 21st Century: As 1997 drew nearer, it became clear that the Chinese government had no intention of renewing the 99-year lease on the New Territories. Negotiations began, and in 1984 Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher signed the Sino-British Joint Declaration, in which Britain confirmed the transfer of the New Territories and all of Hong Kong to China in 1997. For its part, China declared Hong Kong a \"Special Administrative Region\" and guaranteed its civil and social system for at least 50 years after 1997. Although China's Basic Law promised that Hong Kong's existing laws and civil liberties would be upheld, refugees began flowing the other way. The British Nationality Act (1981) had in effect prevented Hong Kong citizens from acquiring British citizenship, and thousands of people, anxious about their future under China's rule, were prompted to apply for citizenship elsewhere, notably in Canada and Australia. The protests in 1989 in Beijing's Tiananmen Square sparked sympathy marches in Hong Kong, and further increased tension with China. Some companies moved their headquarters out of Hong Kong. Ironically, as the handover approached, the British granted the Hong Kong Chinese more political autonomy than they had done since the colony was founded, including such democratic reforms as elections to the Legislative Council. Since the handover in July 1997, China has generally followed a hands-off policy. Many who fled have returned. What controls heartbeats in Hong Kong are the fluctuations of the Hang Seng Index, foreign currency exchange rates, and skyrocketing property prices. In short, the status quo prevails. Everybody hopes Hong Kong will remain stable, but everyone also has their doubts.

Stephen Akerfeldt, currently vice president finance, will succeed Mr. McAlpine. An ambitious expansion has left Magna with excess capacity and a heavy debt load as the automotive industry enters a downturn.

On the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday, Magna shares closed up 37.5 Canadian cents to C$9.625. Mr. Stronach, founder and controlling shareholder of Magna, resigned as chief executive officer last year to seek, unsuccessfully, a seat in Canada's Parliament.

{"question": "Most new lawyers won't consider working for government or public advocacy groups because their need for money to pay off massive student loans leads them to the more lucrative private sector, a study being released Monday found. Legal education debt, which tops $84,000 for the average new lawyer, prevents 66 percent of law students from taking public interest jobs, according to the joint study by Equal Justice Works, the National Association for Law Placement and the Partnership for Public Service. The Washingtonbased groups promote public interest work. \"The bottom line is America's law school graduates are drowning in debt and shut out of public service at a time when the federal government is facing losses of over half its work force due to retirements,\" said Max Stier, president and chief executive of the Partnership for Public Service. More than 94 percent of law students reported borrowing money to attend law school, where median tuition is nearly $23,000 a year, but law students are not alone in having to contend with spiraling education costs. The need to pay off student loans discourages doctors from going to rural communities or inner-city hospitals. A chronic teacher shortage has led some states to consider ways to help teaching-educa-tion students pay off college debts. The student loan agency Nellie Mae says the average college graduate's student-loan debt has reached at least $19,400. In addition, figures for 2000 showed that graduates had average credit card debt of around $2,750. In the law study, about 68 percent of public interest employers surveyed - government offices, legal aid organizations, public defenders and other nonprofit groups - reported recruiting difficulties. Most blamed the combination of low starting salaries and high law school loans for discouraging law students from public service jobs. The report encourages law schools and employers to create programs to help students who choose public service pay back loans in their lower-paying jobs. A few schools, including Harvard, New York and Georgetown universities, already have them. The median starting salary last year at private law firms, was $90,000. By contrast, public interest groups pay new graduates about $35,000, while government pays $40,000 to $45,000.\n\nQuestion: How does Harvard help their students pay back loan?", "answer": ""}

{"question": "Early life Bandura was born in Mundare, in Alberta, a small town of roughly four hundred inhabitants, as the youngest child, and only son, in a family of six. The limitations of education in a remote town such as this caused Bandura to become independent and self-motivated in terms of learning, and these primarily developed traits proved very helpful in his lengthy career. Bandura is of Ukrainian and Polish descent. Bandura's parents were a key influence in encouraging him to seek ventures out of the small hamlet they resided in. The summer after finishing high school, Bandura worked in the Yukon to protect the Alaska Highway against sinking. Bandura later credited his work in the northern tundra as the origin of his interest in human psychopathology. It was in this experience in the Yukon, where he was exposed to a subculture of drinking and gambling, which helped broaden his perspective and scope of views on life.

{"question": "I farther learnt from this intelligent magistrate, that the territory of the Happy Valley, or Okalbia, is divided into forty-two counties, and each county into ten districts.  In each district are three magistrates, who are appointed by the legislature.  Causes of small value are decided by the magistrates of the district; those of greater importance, by the county courts, composed of all the magistrates of the ten districts; a few by the court of last court, consisting of seven judges.  The legislature consists of two houses, of which the members are elected annually, three from each county for one branch, and one member for the other.  No qualification of property is required either to vote, or to be eligible to either house of the legislature, as they believe that the natural influence of property is sufficient, without adding to that influence by law; and that the moral effects of education among them, together with a few provisions in their constitution, are quite sufficient to guard against any improper combination of those who have small property.  Besides, there are no odious privileges exclusively possessed by particular classes of men, to excite the envy or resentment of the other classes, and induce them to act in concert.\n\nQuestion: How many magistrates are there in the territory of the Happy Valley?", "answer": ""}

{"question": "In passing through these checkpoints, each of the hijackers would have been screened by a walk-through metal detector calibrated to detect items with at least the metal content of a .22-caliber handgun. Anyone who might have set off that detector would have been screened with a hand wand-a procedure requiring the screener to identify the metal item or items that caused the alarm. In addition, an X-ray machine would have screened the hijackers' carry-on belongings. The screening was in place to identify and confiscate weapons and other items prohibited from being carried onto a commercial flight. None of the checkpoint supervisors recalled the hijackers or reported anything suspicious regarding their screening. While Atta had been selected by CAPPS in Portland, three members of his hijacking team-Suqami, Wail al Shehri, and Waleed al Shehri-were selected in Boston.

Atta, Omari, and Suqami took their seats in business class (seats 8D, 8G, and 10B, respectively). The Shehri brothers had adjacent seats in row 2 (Wail in 2A, Waleed in 2B), in the firstclass cabin. They boarded American 11 between 7:31 and 7:40. The aircraft pushed back from the gate at 7:40. Shehhi and his team, none of whom had been selected by CAPPS, boarded United 175 between 7:23 and 7:28 (Banihammad in 2A, Shehri in 2B, Shehhi in 6C, Hamza al Ghamdi in 9C, and Ahmed al Ghamdi in 9D). Their aircraft pushed back from the gate just before 8:00. Washington Dulles: American 77. Hundreds of miles southwest of Boston, at Dulles International Airport in the Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C., five more men were preparing to take their early morning flight. At 7:15, a pair of them, Khalid al Mihdhar and Majed Moqed, checked in at the American Airlines ticket counter for Flight 77, bound for Los Angeles. Within the next 20 minutes, they would be followed by Hani Hanjour and two brothers, Nawaf al Hazmi and Salem al Hazmi.\n\nQuestion: In any order, what were the seat numbers of the five men who boarded American 11?", "answer": ""}
{"question": "In passing through these checkpoints, each of the hijackers would have been screened by a walk-through metal detector calibrated to detect items with at least the metal content of a .22-caliber handgun. Anyone who might have set off that detector would have been screened with a hand wand-a procedure requiring the screener to identify the metal item or items that caused the alarm. In addition, an X-ray machine would have screened the hijackers' carry-on belongings. The screening was in place to identify and confiscate weapons and other items prohibited from being carried onto a commercial flight. None of the checkpoint supervisors recalled the hijackers or reported anything suspicious regarding their screening.

{"question": "Weather occurs because of unequal heating of the atmosphere. The source of heat is the sun. The general principles behind weather can be stated simply: The Sun heats Earths surface more in some places than others. Where it is warm, heat from the sun warms the air close to the surface. If there is water at the surface, it may cause some of the water to evaporate. Warm air is less dense, so it rises. When this happens, more dense air flows in to take its place. The flowing surface air is wind. The rising air cools as it goes higher in the atmosphere. If it is moist, the water vapor may condense. Clouds may form, and precipitation may fall.\n\nQuestion: Can you name one general principal behind weather?", "answer": ""}

{"question": "State-mandated course enables nearly 70 percent of divorcing couples to untie the knot without a lawyer. A majority of Vermonters who divorce do so without hiring an attorney. Instead, they take a class on how to represent themselves. The court-mandated session is for people who have filed for divorce and opted not to hire a lawyer. Nearly 70 percent of Vermonters are divorced without an attorney, according to statistics from the Court Administrator's Office. Some are put off by the cost of a hiring a divorce lawyer, which starts at about $1,500. Others just want to be in control of the process. \"There's not a lot of low-cost counsel available. If you've got limited resources and you think you can do it, and the court does help, then maybe this is the one thing that you forego in order to pay for something else,\" said Sally Fox, a former state representative who helped write the legislation to establish Family Courts and who used to be the state director of Family Court operations. There are also risks to going it alone. Many of the decisions that are made in front of a judge cannot be reversed later. The state established a Family Court system in 1990. A separate court system would bring divorce and child custody cases onto the same docket as juvenile cases. The goal was to more quickly resolve cases that had to do with children, Fox said. \"Because it's a place where the needs of children will be paramount, we want it to be a place where you can get these cases resolved quickly,\" Fox said. Family Court was set up as a user-friendly place and continues to add programs to streamline the process. Although the court wasn't necessarily established to allow the majority of Vermonters to represent themselves in a divorce, that has been the effect.

{"question": "On 9/11, the defense of U.S. airspace depended on close interaction between two federal agencies: the FAA and the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD). The most recent hijacking that involved U.S. air traffic controllers, FAA management, and military coordination had occurred in 1993.90 In order to understand how the two agencies interacted eight years later, we will review their missions, command and control structures, and working relationship on the morning of 9/11. FAA Mission and Structure. As of September 11, 2001, the FAA was mandated by law to regulate the safety and security of civil aviation. From an air traffic controller's perspective, that meant maintaining a safe distance between airborne aircraft. Many controllers work at the FAA's 22 Air Route Traffic Control Centers. They are grouped under regional offices and coordinate closely with the national Air Traffic Control System Command Center, located in Herndon, Virginia, which oversees daily traffic flow within the entire airspace system. FAA headquarters is ultimately responsible for the management of the National Airspace System. The Operations Center located at FAA headquarters receives notifications of incidents, including accidents and hijackings. FAA Control Centers often receive information and make operational decisions independently of one another. On 9/11, the four hijacked aircraft were monitored mainly by the centers in Boston, New York, Cleveland, and Indianapolis. Each center thus had part of the knowledge of what was going on across the system. What Boston knew was not necessarily known by centers in New York, Cleveland, or Indianapolis, or for that matter by the Command Center in Herndon or by FAA headquarters in Washington. Controllers track airliners such as the four aircraft hijacked on 9/11 primarily by watching the data from a signal emitted by each aircraft's transponder equipment. Those four planes, like all aircraft traveling above 10,000 feet, were required to emit a unique transponder signal while in flight. On 9/11, the terrorists turned off the transponders on three of the four hijacked aircraft. With its transponder off, it is possible, though more difficult, to track an aircraft by its primary radar returns.

{"question": "(CNN) -- A 19-year-old girl whose hospitalization exposed a shocking Austrian incest case has woken from her coma, a development that could shed new light on what occurred in the basement were she was held captive for decades. Fritzl initially confessed to raping his daughter and having seven children with her. Doctors placed Kerstin Fritzl in an artificial coma in April after she emerged for the first time from the cellar where she was held captive from birth by her father Josef. Kerstin, along with six other children, was born from Josef Fritzl's incestuous relationship with his daughter Elisabeth, now 43, whom he raped repeatedly during the 24 years she was imprisoned beneath his home. Police say Fritzl, 73, has confessed to holding his Elisabeth captive and fathering seven children, six of whom survived. Kerstin was admitted to hospital in Amstetten, west of Vienna, in an unconscious state after Elisabeth persuaded Fritzl that she needed medical attention. Suspicious medics alerted police, who opened an investigation. Detectives began investigating the case after hospital officials started inquiring about the girl's family history.

{"question": "In collaboration with Sigmund Freud and a small group of Freud's colleagues, Adler was among the co-founders of the psychoanalytic movement and a core member of the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society: indeed, to Freud he was \"The only personality there\". He was the first major figure to break away from psychoanalysis to form an independent school of psychotherapy and personality theory, which he called individual psychology because he believed a human to be an indivisible whole, an individuum. He also imagined a person to be connected or associated with the surrounding world. This was after Freud declared Adler's ideas as too contrary, leading to an ultimatum to all members of the Society (which Freud had shepherded) to drop Adler or be expelled, disavowing the right to dissent (Makari, 2008). Nevertheless Freud always took Adler's ideas seriously, calling them \"... honorable errors. Though one rejects the content of Adler's views, one can recognize their consistency and significance\". Following this split, Adler would come to have an enormous, independent effect on the disciplines of counseling and psychotherapy as they developed over the course of the 20th century (Ellenberger, 1970). He influenced notable figures in subsequent schools of psychotherapy such as Rollo May, Viktor Frankl, Abraham Maslow and Albert Ellis. His writings preceded, and were at times surprisingly consistent with, later neo-Freudian insights such as those evidenced in the works of Otto Rank, Karen Horney, Harry Stack Sullivan and Erich Fromm, some considering that it would take several decades for Freudian ego psychology to catch up with Adler's ground-breaking approach. Adler emphasized the importance of equality in preventing various forms of psychopathology, and espoused the development of social interest and democratic family structures for raising children. His most famous concept is the inferiority complex which speaks to the problem of self-esteem and its negative effects on human health (e.g. sometimes producing a paradoxical superiority striving). His emphasis on power dynamics is rooted in the philosophy of Nietzsche, whose works were published a few decades before Adler's. However, Adler's conceptualization of the \"Will to Power\" focuses on the individual's creative power to change for the better. Adler argued for holism, viewing the individual holistically rather than reductively, the latter being the dominant lens for viewing human psychology. Adler was also among the first in psychology to argue in favor of feminism, and the female analyst, making the case that power dynamics between men and women (and associations with masculinity and femininity) are crucial to understanding human psychology (Connell, 1995). Adler is considered, along with Freud and Jung, to be one of the three founding figures of depth psychology, which emphasizes the unconscious and psychodynamics (Ellenberger, 1970; Ehrenwald, 1991); and thus to be one of the three great psychologists/philosophers of the twentieth century.\n\nQuestion: What caused the split between Adler and Freud?", "answer": ""}
{"question": "In collaboration with Sigmund Freud and a small group of Freud's colleagues, Adler was among the co-founders of the psychoanalytic movement and a core member of the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society: indeed, to Freud he was \"The only personality there\". He was the first major figure to break away from psychoanalysis to form an independent school of psychotherapy and personality theory, which he called individual psychology because he believed a human to be an indivisible whole, an individuum. He also imagined a person to be connected or associated with the surrounding world. This was after Freud declared Adler's ideas as too contrary, leading to an ultimatum to all members of the Society (which Freud had shepherded) to drop Adler or be expelled, disavowing the right to dissent (Makari, 2008). Nevertheless Freud always took Adler's ideas seriously, calling them \"... honorable errors. Though one rejects the content of Adler's views, one can recognize their consistency and significance\". Following this split, Adler would come to have an enormous, independent effect on the disciplines of counseling and psychotherapy as they developed over the course of the 20th century (Ellenberger, 1970). He influenced notable figures in subsequent schools of psychotherapy such as Rollo May, Viktor Frankl, Abraham Maslow and Albert Ellis. His writings preceded, and were at times surprisingly consistent with, later neo-Freudian insights such as those evidenced in the works of Otto Rank, Karen Horney, Harry Stack Sullivan and Erich Fromm, some considering that it would take several decades for Freudian ego psychology to catch up with Adler's ground-breaking approach. Adler emphasized the importance of equality in preventing various forms of psychopathology, and espoused the development of social interest and democratic family structures for raising children. His most famous concept is the inferiority complex which speaks to the problem of self-esteem and its negative effects on human health (e.g. sometimes producing a paradoxical superiority striving). His emphasis on power dynamics is rooted in the philosophy of Nietzsche, whose works were published a few decades before Adler's.

{"question": "While glaciers erode the landscape, they also deposit materials. Glaciers deposit their sediment when they melt. They drop and leave behind whatever was once frozen in their ice. Its usually a mixture of particles and rocks. It can be of all sizes, called glacial till. Water from the melting ice may form lakes or other water features. Figure Moraine is sediment deposited by a glacier. A ground moraine is a thick layer of sediments left behind by a retreating glacier. An end moraine is a low ridge of sediments deposited at the end of the glacier. It marks the greatest distance the glacier advanced. A drumlin is a long, low hill of sediments deposited by a glacier. Drumlins often occur in groups. These groups are called drumlin fields. The narrow end of each drumlin points in the direction of an advancing glacier.

An end moraine is a low ridge of sediments deposited at the end of the glacier. It marks the greatest distance the glacier advanced. A drumlin is a long, low hill of sediments deposited by a glacier. Drumlins often occur in groups. These groups are called drumlin fields. The narrow end of each drumlin points in the direction of an advancing glacier. An esker is a winding ridge of sand deposited by a stream of meltwater. Such streams flow underneath a retreating glacier. A kettle lake occurs where a chunk of ice melt as they are left behind as a glacier retreats. When the huge chuck of ice melts it leaves a depression.\n\nQuestion: What can be deducted from the decreasing width of the drumlins groups?", "answer": ""}

{"question": "Suddenly, Amy screamed. I whirled around and threw up my arm just in time to knock Dvorov away. His eyes were glowing red, and he had bared a set of fangs that could probably take my hand off. The dancers near us tried to clear some space. He shot back up, hardly touching the ground, and I kicked him back. He jumped at my arm while I was still off-balance, and I felt the surge of adrenaline that comes right when your body realizes that it’s too late to save itself. A heavy thing hit my arm with a thump and knocked me back against someone with rough paws who held me up. On the floor was Dvorov’s head, separated from his body by several feet and a growing puddle of dark blood. Nepthys stood over him with a blue sword in his hand. It flashed in the strobe where it wasn’t streaked with Dvorov’s blood. “He wasn’t the only one with a secret or two,” he said by way of explanation. “You spotted our boy, didn’t you? I bet his hide-out is nearby, too. Let’s hurry.” He wiped off the sword and sheathed it in a scabbard now belted to his hip. The crowd parted for us. The vampire glanced up when he saw the crowd split and his eyes flashed when he noticed us. In a blink of the strobe light, he was on his feet and dashing from the room. “Come on!” shouted Nepthys. We chased after him, Amy keeping up valiantly behind us. He bashed up a set of stairs set into the side of the wall, and we chased up after him, heading up a huge staircase that seemed to go up for more stories than the building could have held.\n\nQuestion: Did the same person who screamed kill Dvorov?", "answer": ""}

{"question": "A supporter of Cavaignac and of the parti de l'Ordre, Tocqueville, however, accepted an invitation to enter Odilon Barrot's government as Minister of Foreign Affairs from 3 June to 31 October 1849. There, during the troubled days of June 1849, he pleaded with Jules Dufaure, Interior Minister, for the reestablishment of the state of siege in the capital and approved the arrest of demonstrators. Tocqueville, who since February 1848 had supported laws restricting political freedoms, approved the two laws voted immediately after the June 1849 days, which restricted the liberty of clubs and freedom of the press. This active support in favor of laws restricting political freedoms stands in contrast of his defense of freedoms in Democracy in America. According to Tocqueville, he favored order as \"The sine qua non for the conduct of serious politics. He [hoped] to bring the kind of stability to French political life that would permit the steady growth of liberty unimpeded by the regular rumblings of the earthquakes of revolutionary change.'' Tocqueville had supported Cavaignac against Louis Napoleon Bonaparte for the presidential election of 1848. Opposed to Louis Napoleon's 2 December 1851 coup which followed his election, Tocqueville was among the deputies who gathered at the 10th arrondissement of Paris in an attempt to resist the coup and have Napoleon III judged for \"high treason\", as he had violated the constitutional limit on terms of office. Detained at Vincennes and then released, Tocqueville, who supported the Restoration of the Bourbons against Napoleon III's Second Empire (1851-1871), quit political life and retreated to his castle (Chateau de Tocqueville). Against this image of Tocqueville, biographer Joseph Epstein has concluded: \"Tocqueville could never bring himself to serve a man he considered a usurper and despot. He fought as best he could for the political liberty in which he so ardently believed - had given it, in all, thirteen years of his life [....] He would spend the days remaining to him fighting the same fight, but conducting it now from libraries, archives, and his own desk.\" There, he began the draft of L'Ancien Regime et la Revolution, publishing the first tome in 1856, but leaving the second one unfinished.\n\nQuestion: Who pleaded with Jules Dufaure for the reestablishment of the siege in the capital and to give approval for arrest of demonstrators?", "answer": ""}

There, during the troubled days of June 1849, he pleaded with Jules Dufaure, Interior Minister, for the reestablishment of the state of siege in the capital and approved the arrest of demonstrators. Tocqueville, who since February 1848 had supported laws restricting political freedoms, approved the two laws voted immediately after the June 1849 days, which restricted the liberty of clubs and freedom of the press. This active support in favor of laws restricting political freedoms stands in contrast of his defense of freedoms in Democracy in America. According to Tocqueville, he favored order as \"The sine qua non for the conduct of serious politics. He [hoped] to bring the kind of stability to French political life that would permit the steady growth of liberty unimpeded by the regular rumblings of the earthquakes of revolutionary change.'' Tocqueville had supported Cavaignac against Louis Napoleon Bonaparte for the presidential election of 1848. Opposed to Louis Napoleon's 2 December 1851 coup which followed his election, Tocqueville was among the deputies who gathered at the 10th arrondissement of Paris in an attempt to resist the coup and have Napoleon III judged for \"high treason\", as he had violated the constitutional limit on terms of office. Detained at Vincennes and then released, Tocqueville, who supported the Restoration of the Bourbons against Napoleon III's Second Empire (1851-1871), quit political life and retreated to his castle (Chateau de Tocqueville). Against this image of Tocqueville, biographer Joseph Epstein has concluded: \"Tocqueville could never bring himself to serve a man he considered a usurper and despot. He fought as best he could for the political liberty in which he so ardently believed - had given it, in all, thirteen years of his life [....] He would spend the days remaining to him fighting the same fight, but conducting it now from libraries, archives, and his own desk.\" There, he began the draft of L'Ancien Regime et la Revolution, publishing the first tome in 1856, but leaving the second one unfinished.\n\nQuestion: How many years passed between Tocqueville's acceptance of a position as Minister of Foreign Affairs and the publishing of his first tome?", "answer": ""}

{"question": "Flowers have both male and female reproductive parts. The main parts of a flower are shown in Figure 3.21. They include the stamen, pistil, petals, and sepals. The stamen is the male reproductive structure of a flower. It consists of a stalk-like filament. At the end of the filament is the anther. The anther contains pollen sacs. It is here the pollen grains form. The filament raises the anther up high. This helps the pollen to be more likely to be carried away. It may blow in the wind. It may be picked up by an animal and carried away. Many animals are pollinators. A pollinator is any animal who carries the pollen from one plant to another. The pistil is the female reproductive structure of a flower. It consists of a stigma, style, and ovary. The stigma is raised. It is also sticky to help catch pollen.\n\nQuestion: Where do pollen grains form?", "answer": ""}

{"question": "So how do we know that the Earth rotates on its axis? Before this century, all evidence collected about Earths motion came from Earth-bound observations. From Earth-bound observation it is easy to see why, historically, the Earth was stationary. It was the Sun and the stars that orbited the Earth. One simple experiment can be used to show that is not the case. It is the Earth that is rotating causing the cycles we see in the sky. The experiment was designed by Lon Foucault, a French scientist, in the year 1851. He hung a heavy iron weight from a long wire. He pulled the weight to one side and then released it. The weight swung back and forth in a straight line. If Earth did not rotate, the pendulum would never change direction as it moved back and forth. But it did not continue to swing in the same direction. It was thought to change because the Earth was rotating beneath it. Figure 2.49 shows how this might look.\n\nQuestion: What causes the cycles we see in the sky and who experimented that?", "answer": ""}

{"question": "Alexander was born on the sixth day of the ancient Greek month of Hekatombaion, which probably corresponds to 20 July 356 BC, although the exact date is not known, in Pella, the capital of the Kingdom of Macedon. He was the son of the king of Macedon, Philip II, and his fourth wife, Olympias, the daughter of Neoptolemus I, king of Epirus. Although Philip had seven or eight wives, Olympias was his principal wife for some time, likely a result of giving birth to Alexander. Several legends surround Alexander's birth and childhood. According to the ancient Greek biographer Plutarch, Olympias, on the eve of the consummation of her marriage to Philip, dreamed that her womb was struck by a thunder bolt, causing a flame that spread \"far and wide\" before dying away. Some time after the wedding, Philip is said to have seen himself, in a dream, securing his wife's womb with a seal engraved with a lion's image. Plutarch offered a variety of interpretations of these dreams: that Olympias was pregnant before her marriage, indicated by the sealing of her womb; or that Alexander's father was Zeus. Ancient commentators were divided about whether the ambitious Olympias promulgated the story of Alexander's divine parentage, variously claiming that she had told Alexander, or that she dismissed the suggestion as impious. On the day that Alexander was born, Philip was preparing a siege on the city of Potidea on the peninsula of Chalcidice. That same day, Philip received news that his general Parmenion had defeated the combined Illyrian and Paeonian armies, and that his horses had won at the Olympic Games. It was also said that on this day, the Temple of Artemis in Ephesus, one of the Seven Wonders of the World, burnt down. This led Hegesias of Magnesia to say that it had burnt down because Artemis was away, attending the birth of Alexander. Such legends may have emerged when Alexander was king, and possibly at his own instigation, to show that he was superhuman and destined for greatness from conception. In his early years, Alexander was raised by a nurse, Lanike, sister of Alexander's future general Cleitus the Black. Later in his childhood, Alexander was tutored by the strict Leonidas, a relative of his mother, and by Philip's general Lysimachus. Alexander was raised in the manner of noble Macedonian youths, learning to read, play the lyre, ride, fight, and hunt. When Alexander was ten years old, a trader from Thessaly brought Philip a horse, which he offered to sell for thirteen talents. The horse refused to be mounted and Philip ordered it away.\n\nQuestion: Who had strange dreams about Olympias' womb?", "answer": ""}

On the day that Alexander was born, Philip was preparing a siege on the city of Potidea on the peninsula of Chalcidice. That same day, Philip received news that his general Parmenion had defeated the combined Illyrian and Paeonian armies, and that his horses had won at the Olympic Games. It was also said that on this day, the Temple of Artemis in Ephesus, one of the Seven Wonders of the World, burnt down. This led Hegesias of Magnesia to say that it had burnt down because Artemis was away, attending the birth of Alexander. Such legends may have emerged when Alexander was king, and possibly at his own instigation, to show that he was superhuman and destined for greatness from conception. In his early years, Alexander was raised by a nurse, Lanike, sister of Alexander's future general Cleitus the Black. Later in his childhood, Alexander was tutored by the strict Leonidas, a relative of his mother, and by Philip's general Lysimachus. Alexander was raised in the manner of noble Macedonian youths, learning to read, play the lyre, ride, fight, and hunt.

{"question": "Alexander was born on the sixth day of the ancient Greek month of Hekatombaion, which probably corresponds to 20 July 356 BC, although the exact date is not known, in Pella, the capital of the Kingdom of Macedon.

Although Philip had seven or eight wives, Olympias was his principal wife for some time, likely a result of giving birth to Alexander. Several legends surround Alexander's birth and childhood.

{"question": "Shrinking revenue is forcing Legal Aid of West Virginia to close six satellite offices and lay off 17 employees by January. The agency provides free legal representation in civil cases to about 24,000 low-income people annually. Legal Aid lawyers help victims of domestic violence, and they supervise the ombudsman program that sends advocates into all the state's nursing homes. \"We are here for people who have no place to turn,\" Adrienne Worthy, executive director for the agency, said Tuesday. \"Our phones ring off the hook now. I do not look forward to saying, 'I'm sorry. We can't help you.\"' The Legal Aid board agreed Saturday to close satellite offices in Fayetteville, Madison, Pineville, Welch, Winfield and Williamson. Satellite facilities in Clay, Hamlin and Summersville and all 11 regional offices will remain open. Decreases in two funding sources prompted the cuts, Worthy said. Legal Aid gets funding from the federal Legal Services Corp. based on a formula that counts the number of poor people in a service area. West Virginia lost 30,000 poor people, according to Census figures used by the Legal Services Corp. The population drop will reduce Legal Aid of West Virginia's budget by $400,000. The agency also receives a percentage of money from the Interest On Lawyers' Trust Accounts.

{"question": "It was a beautiful sunny and warm day. I was working outside in my garden. I was pulling weeds which is not my favorite job, but I was enjoying the day. I live by a lake so sometimes I take a break from my chores and look at the lake. It is so beautiful and it makes me happy to look at the beautiful lake and see what animals I can find swimming in or near the lake. On this day, I kept hearing a low soft sound coming from the lake. I got up from my garden and walked to the lake. I kept hearing this strange sound. It sounded like someone talking in a very low voice. I thought it might be a lake bird because we see and hear them all of the time. The lake birds have several different calls that tell what they want to \"say\" to other lake birds. There is the call when they are flying which is very hurried and short. Then there is the \"where are you\" call which is long, slow and loud. But this sound was not like any I had ever heard. I went to get the binoculars to see if I could spot anything. But, no luck. I still kept hearing this low talking sound. I had now totally given up weeding. Finding this strange sound was going to be more fun. But where was it coming from? I looked again up and down the lake and saw nothing. Finally I went around to the other side of the place where we keep our boats. There is an area there where it is not a very deep part of the water. I spotted them! It was a mother lake bird and a father lake bird with a baby in between them. They were teaching the baby how to swim and eat fish. The low talking sound that I heard must have been them trying to teach the baby to swim and eat the fish. I sat there on the bank and watched for a half an hour. I felt very special that I got to see this. It was such a fun thing to see and way more fun than gardening.\n\nQuestion: Were the lake birds near the boats?", "answer": ""}

Finally I went around to the other side of the place where we keep our boats. There is an area there where it is not a very deep part of the water. I spotted them! It was a mother lake bird and a father lake bird with a baby in between them. They were teaching the baby how to swim and eat fish. The low talking sound that I heard must have been them trying to teach the baby to swim and eat the fish. I sat there on the bank and watched for a half an hour. I felt very special that I got to see this. It was such a fun thing to see and way more fun than gardening.\n\nQuestion: What was making the strange sound?", "answer": ""}
{"question": "In 1917, Einstein applied the general theory of relativity to model the structure of the universe as a whole. He apprehended that his equations predicted the universe to be either contracting or expanding. He wanted the universe to be eternal and unchanging, but this type of universe is not consistent with relativity. To fix this, Einstein modified the general theory by introducing a new notion, the cosmological constant, which he called ''Lambda''. The purpose of Lambda was to rectify the effects of gravity and allow the whole system to stay balanced. With a positive cosmological constant, the universe could be an eternal static sphere. However, in 1929, Edwin Hubble confirmed that the universe is expanding, Einstein exclaimed after his Mount Wilson visit with Hubble: \"If there is no quasi-static world, then away with the cosmological term!\" and Einstein supposedly discarded the cosmological constant. Einstein believed a spherical static universe is philosophically preferred, because it would obey Mach's principle. He had shown that general relativity incorporates Mach's principle to a certain extent in frame dragging by gravitomagnetic fields, but he knew that Mach's idea would not work if space goes on forever. In a closed universe, he believed that Mach's principle would hold. Mach's principle has generated much controversy over the years. In many of Einstein biographies, writers claim that he called the creation of Lambda his \"biggest blunder\". Recently, astrophysicist Mario Livio showed that Einstein possibly never said that. Instead of discarding Lambda, Einstein was continually experimenting with it. In late 2013, Irish physicist Cormac O'Raifeartaigh, happened to discover a handwritten manuscript by Einstein which was since then overlooked by other scientists. The research paper was titled ''\"Zum kosmologischen Problem\"'' (\"About the Cosmological Problem\"). And Einstein proposed a revision of his model, still with a cosmological constant, but now the constant was responsible for the creation of new matter as the universe expanded.\n\nQuestion: The discovery of an expanding universe by what scientist caused Einstein to discard his cosmological constant?", "answer": ""}

{"question": "A congressional agency that funds legal services for low-income Americans is battling Charleston lawyers over control of buildings that once housed legal assistance programs in Charleston, Georgetown and Conway. At stake is prime real estate in the coastal cities, including a Charleston building in the heart of upscale commercial development on upper King Street. The Washington-based Legal Services Corp. wants the buildings transferred to the S.C. Centers for Equal Justice, said LSC spokesman Eric Kleiman. The LSC was once the funding agency for the Neighborhood Legal Assistance Program Corp. in Charleston. In January, the LSC funding went to the Greenville-based equal justice centers. In an Aug. 21 letter to NLAP board chairman Gerald A. Kaynard, LSC president John N. Erlenborn said: \"If NLAP fails to effectuate these transfers by Aug. 31, LSC will take all necessary steps to protect its interest in these properties.\" Kaynard did not return repeated phone calls from The Post and Courier. As part of its funding agreement, the LSC requires property purchased with government funds be returned to the nonprofit corporation if a local agency loses its grant, Kleiman said. In August, the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that requirement in a lawsuit LSC filed in a property dispute with a legal services program in Big Stone Gap, Va. Kleiman said, \"We will continue to work with NLAP to work out an orderly transfer of the property. We hope this can be resolved amicably.\" Last year, NLAP lost its federal grant with a nationwide consolidation of legal aid programs. In January, the federal agency awarded a $4.4 million grant to the Centers for Equal Justice, which has a Charleston area office and sites in 11 other South Carolina cities.\n\nQuestion: What is the full name of the organization that lost its federal grant with a nationwide consolidation of legal aid programs?", "answer": ""}

{"question": "(CNN) -- Three human heads and three decapitated bodies with notes aimed at high government officials were found Thursday in different parts of Guatemala's capital, national police said. The notes were addressed to Interior Minister Carlos Menocal and Eddy Morales, the nation's director of prisons. One of the notes said the officials must impose order in the nation's prisons or these atrocities would continue, police said. The other said that impunity against lawlessness must end, according to police. The heads were inside plastic bags, one of them in front of the main doors to the national Congress in Guatemala City, police said. \"That's obviously a first for Guatemala,\" said Samuel Logan, an expert on Latin American gangs and founding editor of the Southern Pulse intelligence report. \"That's something we've seen the Zetas (drug cartel) do in Mexico.\" Donald Gonzalez, a spokesman for the national police, attributed the slayings to the Zetas or another narcotrafficking group, the Prensa Libre newspaper reported.
