{"question": "In a shipping container, there are 10 crates. Each crate is filled with 6 boxes and each box is filled with 4 washing machines. A worker removes 1 washing machine from each box. There are no other changes. How many washing machines were removed from the shipping container?", "answer": "Initially, there were 6 boxes * 4 washing machines per box = 24 washing machines in each crate.\nSo there were 24 washing machines per crate * 10 crates = 240 washing machines in the shipping container.\nA worker removes 1 washing machine from each box so there are now 4 original washing machines - 1 removed washing machine = 3 washing machines in each box.\nThis means there are 6 boxes * 3 washing machines per box = 18 washing machines in each crate.\nSo there are now 18 washing machines per crate * 10 crates = 180 washing machines in the shipping container.\nThe difference is how many machine washing machines were removed which is 240 initial washing machines \u2013 180 current washing machines = 60 washing machines.\n#### 60"}
{"question": "Mark plants some strawberries in his backyard. Every month, the number of strawberry plants doubles. After 3 months, Mark digs up 4 strawberry plants and gives them to his friend.  If he still has 20 strawberry plants, how many did he initially plant?", "answer": "First, add the 4 plants Mark gave away to the 20 he has left: 4 + 20 = 24\nThen divide this number by 2 to find how many plants Mark had after two months: 24 / 2 = 12\nThen divide that number by 2 to find how many plants Mark had after one month: 12 / 2 = 6\nFinally, divide that number by 2 to find out how many plants Mark initially planted: 6 / 2 = 3\n#### 3"}
{"question": "Brogan has two apple trees and goes to harvest them. The first tree is 40% red and 60% green. The second tree is 50% red and 50% green.

{"question": "Bob, Tom, Sally, and Jerry had dinner at their favorite pizzeria. They decide to share 2 pizzas. Bob ate half of a pizza on his own. Tom ate one-third of a pizza. Sally wasn't very hungry and only ate one-sixth of a pizza, and Jerry ate a quarter of a pizza. If each pizza is cut into 12 slices, how many slices were left over?", "answer": "Each pizza is 12 slices. Bob at 12 slices / 2 = 6 slices.\nTom ate one third, or 12 slices / 3 = 4 slices.\nSally ate one sixth, or 12 slices / 6 = 2 slices.\nJerry ate one quarter, or 12 slices / 4 = 3 slices.\nIn total, they ate 6 slices + 4 slices + 2 slices + 3 slices = 15 slices.\nSo they were left with 12 slices per pizza * 2 pizzas - 15 slices = 24 slices - 15 slices = 9 slices.\n#### 9"}
